the formatted overlay in svb input text fields  and the underlying text are appearing at the same time on IE
also it appears the formatted input is not changing in real time as we change the value of the field.








2/1/16 Backlog grooming Notes:
Are we going to have a responsive presentation for Beta ?
	•	Tom. weÕre currently MVP
	•	Responsive is not Absolutely necessary for Beta
	◦	Its a nice to have

We may open a story and all responsive tickets get
Or we will just open std tickets and make sure they are labled "Responsive"

Open story for payment home
Payee name then nickname  these are likely to swap

Nickname first and display if its there otherwise show payee name
This will be interesting because there are a couple of places where there is no NN ,  In the free form entry

Next sprint capturing audits
	•	This story is about capturing data from what we see as an autidable event
	◦	edit payee or some other eventsÉ..
	•	subsequent story will begin to capture the data 



Filter for creation date
	•	begin and end calendar windows
