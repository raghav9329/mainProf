347 Payment processing days ( scheduled pay )
from Last Sprint

This is a finish up getting the schedule day into
the payment form.

Acceptance criteria:
- I can see the next valid payment date on the make payment form based on the UK branch schedule for processing payments.
- I can confirm the date for this payment once it has been submitted in the payments list on the payments home page.

Assumptions:
- Needs to work along with the cutoff times MPAY-102.
- Does not include recurring payments.
- No localization; assumes the user is sitting in London (GMT / UTC time zone).
- Validation for cutoff time will be based on server time at time page was loaded and when submitted.
- No messaging when user passes the cutoff time while sitting on page; this change is a separate story in backlog MPAY-845.
- Payments are automatically set to the next valid payment date when the cutoff time has passed during the payment submission workflow.
