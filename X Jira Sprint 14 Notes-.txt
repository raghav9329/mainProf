794: Payment Home | Sort payment transactions
As a user entitled to create payments, I want to view our payment transactions in a specific order on the Payment Home so I can reconcile our payment activity.

	Acceptance criteria:
- I can see our payment transactions defaulted to the sort order of descending by scheduled date when I land on the Payment Home.
- I can sort our payment transactions either by scheduled date, payee or payment amount.
- I can click on the arrow next to each column heading to sort payment transactions in descending order first.  
- I can click on the same arrow heading again in that column to sort payment transactions in ascending order.

****Test

941: Status and payment ID in payment details

As a user, I want to see critical information for each payment transaction so that I can reconcile our payment activity.
	Acceptance criteria:
	▪	I can see the payment ID (number) for a selected payment transaction on the Payment Homepage in the payment details area.
	▪	I can always see the status for a selected payment transaction on the Payment Homepage in the payment details area.
	▪	I can see that the payment status is "Scheduled" when a payment has been submitted by the user but hasn't yet been sent and accepted by SOA.
	▪	I can see that the payment status is "Sent" once the payment has been accepted by SOA.


****Test Ñ this feels weak

	1.	Status & Payment ID , payment details | Status & ID in the details area 
	1.	Make a complete payment.  confirm receipt of the Payment ID as it is reviewable in the payment details.
	2.	Make another complete payment. See the status of the payment change from Scheduled to Sent after SOA accepts the payment
