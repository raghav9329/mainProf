Each have 4 funding accounts
*_fps limits at $30K per funding account
*fps2 limits at $60K per funding account
Current funding accounts for each of these users is *2203, *2211, *2181, *5436
Additionally there are Max Transaction limits that can come into play as well
If they are lower than the funding account limit you will not be able to meet
the funding account limit all in one payment.  This may be ok.
