Api uniformity
Where we can, pull calls that go dirfectly into protractor into the page object layer.  Wrap them and exose them
in the api layer.

I woudn't want the CAlls to protractor like WAit Calls or Expected Conditions ( wait things ) to be in the 
test script.  I would want them to be in the page object layer and automatic.  The tester ( script writer ) shoudn't
have to think about his code needing to wait.  s/he should only be thinkin about test activities.



Dependencts page.  How are these methods/functions used
Examples Simple.
Does a single example cover all similar conditions.  means can I write once and not for every function ?
Are the functions similar enough to have one example cover them all


 For example say we have to use the

We need details on the following level.
IF I were explaining to a user how to code for deleting a dependent.
Could I tell them to call deleteDependent on their dependent variable, or would I have to tell them to 
call deleteDependent.click().

Theis is an example where we are requiring the developer to cross bounderies that shouldn't be crossed.
The Test Writer doesn't want to be constrained by Protractgor calls.  Protractgor should all b e managed by the 
Page object layer.  Clicks, button push, send keys, etc. selenium actions   should not be in the top layer
These calls needed to be handled in the MId Object layers.
