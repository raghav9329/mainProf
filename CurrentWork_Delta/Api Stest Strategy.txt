Test automation Micro service APIs
The philosophical basis of Application Programming Interfaces is to decouple the consumer from the internal workings of the publisher

API Engineering states this is no guraentee on the known technology persisting published data.
API Engineering will only guraentee an APIs contract of specific output baseded upon valid input.

The correctness of a GET API will have to be relied upon 


Validation of API's that return data will have to rely on the stated contract of the api

Valdation of APIs that do not return data but effect a change in the persisted data 
will have to rely on GET API for this pair in order to validate the change effected by the previous API call



APIs will be of two types.
* Ones that return data
* Ones that affect the persisted data.


API Publication Rule:
An Api that affects persisted data 
will be delivered with an api to retrieve data.

This pariing is the only way to inspect the correctness of the API that affects a change tothe persisted data.










End.
