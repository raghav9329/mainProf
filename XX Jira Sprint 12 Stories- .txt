XX Jira Sprint 12 Stories:  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/25/16 Define the model I was thinking about for Story Tests and entries within the story. Start:   Stories must be testable. Story details must be testableÉ.. best example mpay-107.4 I can see if I've already saved a payee with the same nickname. • Since you are in the process of saving , and have not YET saved, you cannot know this from any interface built.  You must try and get an error to confirm it had already existed.    This case is a VERY fine point. My tests should refererence what I wrote above.  mpay-107 has 5 acceptance criteria.  That is what I test against for closeout.  so I need to name my test like this reference so staff can look back in to the past and have a clear understanding as to what requirement was being tested by which test case !  ********************* **   NOTE:ÉÉ NOT DONEÉÉ... **   I need to return to 107 and make sure IÕve correctly identify all the odd ways the modal  **  dialogs can be used / subverted and make sure they are all catching what they are supposed **  to catch. ******************** 1/25/16  Closing MPAY-107  NOTES: Still need to examine odd and unusual ways pay-864 can be stuttered through and screw things up. Its not severe and I can move the story on, but I do need to examine and report. mpay-849 is fixed and doesnÕt need much evaluation. What I need to do is finish all the test that I wrote for it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/22/16 Eric P.  Wrote  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/21/16  HerÕs the order Eric asked me to prioritize in 806 Make Payment Form | Style Payment Date Field • mpay-850 Make Payment Form | Style Payment Date Field  Icon  is removed for Beta • Done  107 Save payee after making payment Acceptance criteria: - I can view the payee details on the confirmation overlay. - I can enter a unique nickname for the payee. - I can save the payee. - I can see if I've already saved a payee with the same nickname. - I can confirm the payee was saved by viewing the payee list in the make payment form. • Test:  807  Make sure a saved payee has a nickname in the make pay form payee dropdown • mpay-846 is a test in support of this  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTE:  Remember to use the Period Ô.Õ and the Enter Key to open a Link creation dialog Set Relates to Set Issue and you are done -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/19/16 731 422 Story is closed due to things and to 822
