Our Product Limits expensive db hits via a db caching refresh process.  
This 15 cache refresh is prohibitive for testing db changes and the effect on code execution.
Using  CA Nolio has allowed me to perform continual application module deployments
effectively accomplish DB refresh and see a change in the application.

Limit Testing: Having gotten some solid ground under my feet with db refresh late in day, the next move will at a high level followÉÉ

First : find proper control over Faster Payment , system wide limit.
Payments.Payment_type.MAX_SYS_TRAN_AMT This value is set to 100K
Setting all client Max Values to greater than this limit allows me to expose any FASTER payment being made to run into this limit first. Changing this value and observing its change in the app behavior.
This is done, but I need to extend with a number of users and clients in order to exercise the limit.

Second: With other Clients using NON_FASTER Payment system I can configure Client Cumulative limits without
bumping into the system wide FASTER Limit.  User per transaction limits are set to < cumulative limit,
but > cumulative limit / 2.  In this way I can get a good read with just a few payments made.


Third: Client Transaction limits are implemented not because the product needs them to operate, but to
provide a safety net for mis configured dbs since we donÕt have a UI to elegantly see these configuration 
at this time. The CliXaction limit has to be set lower than the lower than the UserXaction limit ( or set eh UserXaction limit higher for the test
