Acceptance_Matrix


All Users for client presented with Dashboard:
A Newly added user with UK Murano Payees entitlement:  They open the Murano Dashboard

	•	The Team 1 Murano Dashboard is Very Angular.  So, we should only have to look in the code of the page
	•	to see that they either got a very angualr page or one that is not like that at all
===========
With a set of users known to have UK Murano Payment entitlement, navigate to Home Page
if Angular Team 1 page : Pass
If not Angular Team 1 Page: Fail

With A set of users who are NOT UK Murano entitled, navigate to Murano Home page
If eConnect Home page: Pass
What would be a  failed ???  We are not give page signature so ???

With a Set of users who are Murano UK Entitied, but they are one the Black List
If Angular Team 1 page :  FAIL
IF Angular eC page : Pass

===================================
Add a new user

Do we add user programmatically ??  maybe scripting

Any way, Client gets new user, and by definition means Entitled UK payments
Does new user get proper dashboard.  ??

==============================
All users for client had dashboard removed
This administrative control should automatically give all users
to this client the eC dashboard

=======================
