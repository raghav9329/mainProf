Acceptance_Matrix


Dashboard Entitlement-
All Users for client presented with Dashboard:
A Newly added user with UK Murano Payees entitlement:  They open the Murano Dashboard

	•	The Team 1 Murano Dashboard is Very Angular.  So, we should only have to look in the code of the page
	•	to see that they either got a very angualr page or one that is not like that at all
===========
With a set of users known to have UK Murano Payment entitlement, navigate to Home Page
if Angular Team 1 page : Pass
If not Angular Team 1 Page: Fail

With A set of users who are NOT UK Murano entitled, navigate to Murano Home page
If eConnect Home page: Pass
What would be a  failed ???  We are not give page signature so ???

With a Set of users who are Murano UK Entitied, but they are one the Black List
If Angular Team 1 page :  FAIL
IF Angular eC page : Pass

===================================
Dashboard Entitlement-
Add a new user:

Do we add user programmatically ??  maybe scripting

Any way, Client gets new user, and by definition means Entitled UK payments
Does new user get proper dashboard.  ??

==============================

Dashboard Entitlement-
All users for client had dashboard removed:
This administrative control should automatically give all users
to this client the eC dashboard


=======================
Account View-
Accounts Visible on initial set up
For a given user, We need to know a users account #s and accounts balances
This could be fixed, or queried for 

=======================
Account View-
Account(s) removed from view / access
Log on as a specific user.  recored a list of the accounts available
This means these accounts are entitled to be seen/accessed ( funding accounts )
Take entitlement away on an account
Reevaluate the list of available accounts.  It must decrease the same as entitlement taken away.

=======================
Account View-
Account(s) added to view / access
Execute the corollary to the test above.  Add to the list of accounts available.
=======================

Account / Limit - 
User Account Limits   ( This needs to be broken down )  very big statement.

User Per Trans action
Cumulaitve limt per day at user level
Client per transaction
Client limit per day ( Single or multiple )

Here are the values and settings to set this sequence of test up properly. Names are not going to be exactly correct, but it should be obvious within minutes of reading all of this.

This setup comes out of MPAY-1538.
IÕve rearranged the placement of the limits in a (slightly) more logical order
Moved 51K up under 25K  
Test setup JavaScript Protractor file paymentServiceScripts.js or DBConnectionManager.js

Set  FPS System Limit :  

Set a users Max transaction limit ( diff users can have diff Limits )
PAYMENT.PAYMENT_TYPE.MAX_SYS_TRAN_AMT $100000  WHERE INTERNAL_NAME == PAYMENT_FPS  

Set a Max for a users per Transaction amount
ENTITLEMENT.USER_ENTITLEMENT.MAX_TRAN_AMT == $25000

Set a Max Limit on individual Client Transaction( diff users can have diff limits )
This value limits a clients exposure if the user limit is miss configured 
ENTITLEMENT.CLIENT_LIMIT.MAX_PER_TRAN_AMT == $51000

Set a Max for a users accumulation for a day
ENTITLEMENT.USER_ENTITLEMENT.MX_DAILY_CUMULATIVE_LIMIT == $55000

Set a Max for a Clients accumulation for a day
ENTITLEMENT.CLIENT_LIMIT.MAX_DAILY_TRAN_AMT == $80000


These queries are going to have to be corrected and be more UserID or Client ID specific.
Previous testing simply set the same value on every db row.  I need to focus on one specific user row

// User Per TransAction Amount: Testing 25K
update USER_ENTITLEMENT SET MAX_TRAN_AMT = 25000
WHERE function_name like 'CREATE_%' and user_id in (select user_id from  USER_ENTITLEMENT where MAX_TRAN_AMT != 25000 );
commit ;


// User Cumulative Limit per day: Testing 55K
update USER_ENTITLEMENT SET MAX_DAILY_CUMULATIVE_LIMIT = 55000
WHERE function_name like 'CREATE_%' and user_id in (select user_id from  USER_ENTITLEMENT where MAX_DAILY_CUMULATIVE_LIMIT != 55000);
commit;

// Client Per Transaction Amount: Testing 51K
update CLIENT_LIMIT SET MAX_PER_TRAN_AMT = 51000
WHERE function_name like 'CREATE_%' and client_id  in (select client_id  from  CLIENT_LIMIT where MAX_PER_TRAN_AMT != 51000);
commit;

// Client Cumulaitve Limit Per Day: Testing 80K
update CLIENT_LIMIT SET MAX_DAILY_TRAN_AMT = 80000
WHERE function_name like 'CREATE_%' and client_id in (select client_id from  CLIENT_LIMIT where MAX_DAILY_TRAN_AMT != 80000) ;
commit;

TESTING FPS System Limits :  in the following order
Logon as FPS Client User #1
  -1) Create payment 100,000.01 Should FAIL				With all limits set low MAX_FPS still not achievable
  -2) Create a payment of 25,000.01 Should FAIL			0.01 greater than User Max Tran
  -3) Create a payment of 25K should PASS				At Lim of User Max Tran & 25K into User Cumulative Lim
  -4) Create a payment of 25,000.01 should FAIL			0.01 greater than User Max Tran
  -5) Create a payment of 25K Should PASS				At Lim of User Max Tran & 50K into User Cumulative Lim
  -6) Create a payment of 5,000.1 Should FaIL			0.01 greater than User Cumulative Lim 
  -7) Create a payment of 5K Should PASS				Now Matches the User Cumulative Limt or 55K
  -8) Create a payment of 0.01 Should FAIL				0.01 greater than the User Cumulative Limit or 55K

Login as FPS Client User #2							.

  -9) Create payment of 25,000.01 Should FAIL			0.01 greater than Client Cumulative limit
-10) Create payment of 25K Should PASS				Matches the Client Cumulative Limit 80K
-11) Create payment of 0.01 Should FAIL				0.01 greater than Client Cumulative limit 80K

Modify  User Transaction Limit Value from 25K to 125K	Remove USER Per Transaction & cumulative Limits
Login as new Client User #3							.

-12) Create a payment of 51,000.01 Should FAIL			0.01 greater than Client Max per Transaction
-13) Create a payment of 51K Should PASS				At Lim of Cli Per trans 51K
Modify Client Per Transaction limit 51K to 151K			.
-14) Create a payment of 55,000.01 Should FAIL			At Limi of User Cumulative Limit 55K
-15) Create a payment of 55K Should PASS				Matches Limit of user Cumulative Limit 55K

Modify User Cumulative Limit 55K to 155K
Login as a new user

=======================
Account / Limit - 
User Account limit exceeds the faster payment threashold ( 100K ) was our manual test setting.

"Singular test within the larger Limits Test suite"

Since it is un likely that any of the other user/client type limits would exceed the value the may payment that FPS will support,
hereÕs how this is tested.
All the lower limits are raised above the FPS limit, making FPS the lowest limit. Then, the coded logic will finally run into this limit.

Limits are set in the db.
See the test above

=======================
Account / Limit - 
User Access to Dormant Account

Flexcube specific:  Have to entitle to an acct that is in dormant status ( in FC )
Dorment acct WILL NOT show up in the Funding acct list !!!
Check that they have entitielent to this acct, then check the FE
if acct is dormant and shows in app, that is a FAIL
WE dont' want to see it.

To Test:
Do this backward from how Susan spoke of it and how I wrote it.
Start with an account I have entitlement & access to and can see.
Logout as this user.  Clear the cache and history
Then have FC make the account Entitled and DORMANT.
Login as this user If the Account is GONE:  PASS
If the account is visible :  FAIL


=======================
Account / Limit -
User Access to Closed Account

FC has a status of Closed.
We will have to toggle the FC OPEN CLOSED Status

To Test: 
Open with a user who has entitlement to a specific account
Make a payment with said account : PASS
Programmatically change the status of the account 
Re open the make payment page 
If the funding account is there : FAIL
If the funding account is missing : PASS

=======================
Account / Limit -
User Access to USD Account

To Test:
Take a client and user and make sure they can see the account from Dashboard they are entitled to see a USD account
Entitle a UK Client User to have access to a USD acocunt
They can see the account in the UK Dashboard : PASS
Open the Make Payment page.
They can See the USD account in the dropdown : FAIL
The CANNOT see the USD account in the dropdown : PASS

=======================
FPS- No Exception
Immediate Faster Payment (Pre-Cut Off) on Account with no exceptions

To Test:
Send Faster Payment before cutoff
We need to see the FC output.  ( I say:  Hummmm. selenium web driver.
I now know this is not as easliy feasible as I had thought.
FC is a Web Java APP , not a web page.



=======================
FPS- No Exception
Account with no exceptions, future dated [NOTE - covers scenario for post cut-off)

After cutoff. Get the next bus day as the payment date!
And we want to see in _FC_ that it get's processed at 6:00 am +300ms
To Test:
Commit a payment after cutoff.  
Validate the next day as payment.
Camp out on the process until 6:00 AM London time/
Payment transitions from Scheduled to Sent  : PASS
No changes to the payment : FAIL


=======================
FPS- No Exception
Account with no exceptions, future dated [NOTE - covers scenario for bank holidays)

Most automated testing takes place in the present.  ItÕs a right now concept.
Do something to the App.  Evaluate the response.
but here we a scheduling something that will no trigger for three days.  This by common automation standards is not automate-able.
this is not easy to automate because of the longer duration than a weekend.
Still if we had better management of the Holiday calendar we should be able to manage this.
Bank Holidays.  Friday night submission. Sat, Sun, MonHOliday.
Payment date is set for Tuesday.
To Test:
Open and make a payment on Friday night
Let it sit and evaluate on Monday

=======================
FPS- Overrides
Account with No Debits, soft hold

NO DEBITS is a FC concept that stops smooth flowthroughÉ.
Pay gets into FC and an FC user has to interact to push payment through FC
Approve or reject are the operator's options in FC
Pmt Request gets into FC in Payment Pending Auth
 
Approved: would not show any indication.  All would be well with the pay workflow w.r.t the mpayments user
 
Rejected: Payment would still say "SENT", but would FAIL and user shojuld be getting a phone call from FC Administrator

To Test:
If we can gain access to the pending auth queue ÉÉ..
Again this will be difficult to automate


=======================
FPS- Overrides
Fraud threshold exceeded (Txn exceeds £20,000)

This is none of the other conceptual limits built in our system.
This is an arbitrary thing the bank does on a whim .
Value set in FC.  Hit this limit and you go into pending Auth Queue.   ----  Just like the previous story there are no indications to the user in the murano payments app that this has happened
Will hapend TO ALL Account types regardless if the hit the limit.

To Test: 
Requires some kind of access into FC we need to see the Pending Auth Queue ( if there is such a thing )
Initiate a payment 
Check Queue

See Queue Empty (on some admin action ) : PASS
Any form of rejection : FAIL

=======================
FPS- Overrides
FPS Limit Exceeded
This should result in a faliure

To Test: 
Likely to use All the DB Management Limit setting , getting them all out of the way so that $100K is the lowest limit.
Submit a payment above the FPS limit
Payment rejected: PASS
Payment accepted: FAIL



=======================
FPS- Overrides
Account overdrawn with no facility

Goes into a Pending Auth Queue
Could be accepted or rejected.  
We have no visibility in the app

To Test: 
If we can gain access to the pending auth queue
may be we can approve or reject.
Approve would simply move on with no observable interaction
Reject would never debit the account, but no other observation to make




=======================
FPS Ð Errors -
Account with No Debits hard hold

Immediate rejection.  No indication in Murano payments App
FC will never acknowledge/ record the payment .  Its like it never happened.
But, we publish an end point that FC can grab and write to the DB about this failure
Email is also gened to the UK Payment operations people
 
To Test: 
Until we can get FC to grab onto our failureNotificaiton EndPoint and record transaction failure 
We will not be able to test this.

=======================
FPS Ð Errors -
Account closed - Payment from (payment made mid closure)
 
Special condition between today and tomorrow
This morning account is open.  Noon account is closed
Afternoon a payment is made against this account.
It will go to FC  ===== And Susan has to check what happens.  We think it will be Pending Auth then reject
 
 
To Test: 
There is research testing tat needs to be done before we can identify how to automate this testing procedure.

=======================
FPS Ð Errors -
Account closed - Payment to
the closed account is on the receiving end on , IE the Payees Account
The payment would go through as everthing is valid
pay sits at the other end of un posted transactions.
No indication to the user on our end of the failure to receive funds.
 
To Test: 
This one will be on the back burner until we figure how to resolve the transaction failure.
From our perspective , all will be green lighted. The funding account will never be debited ( for real )
( maybe it will but will be sitting in a bank queue that will have to be backed out upon fail discovery )


=======================
FPS Ð Errors -
Account dormant - Payment From (payment made mid dormant)
 
Behavior will be the same as payee made mid closure.
There are issues relating to before and after cutoff
To Test: 
Currently unknown

=======================
FPS Ð Errors -
Account Invalid : Negative type test.
Susan states :  As New users are added and existing users are modified THROUGH THE SCRIPTING Process
We need to enter incorrect data for account numbers

To Test: 
Login before scrpipting  the problem , record and validate the users Fund acct list.  recored your list.
Run a minor version of the scripting that add / modifies Clients or Client Users
Login as one of the Client users and review the funding accounts.  ThatÕs were things are supposed to be screwed up.
One would think with some Referential Integrity built into the produce ( not speaking DB level where I always expect it )
We should show only valid accounts against the list recorded before the scripting to mess up accts..  
View a known messed up funding account :FAIL
View only known good accounts : PASS

=======================
FPS Ð Errors -
Account NOT of GBP

To Test: 
From FC enable a UK Payments user to have $USD account
open make payment dropdown  See the $USD account:  FAIL
open make payment dropdown  Do Not See the $USD account:  PASS


=======================
Authentication Testing -
User makes payment with successful code entry--CTV and TTV:

Currently TTV is the only service we would be able to automate
Voice requires a human at this point in Test Technology Developent

To Test: 
I have to research how DT has done this in the past
Do we have access to the value sent to the phone, if so, thatÕs half the equation ( not half the problem )
Do we / can we simulate sending a text from a specific Ph# back to the host.



=======================
Authentication Testing -
User attempts to enter code incorrectly 3 times and is frozen
We need to incorporate use of the Audit Report and scan for specific a specific user transaction row ,
and for specific information in that row  With that we ca É...

To Test: 
CTV fail:  First time we need to look at the AuditReport and see one fail , but user status still active.
CTV Fail:  2nd time. look at audit report again user status: active
CTV Fail:  3rd time, look at the audit report:  USER STATUS FROZEN, but  the account has not been Invalidated
	•	The account is left active ( you are logged in )  Here we have two pathways:  
	◦	one-logout and see you are frozen out
	◦	two-remain and continue :  ( this has two pathways )
	▪	Successfully pass the test and you should go back to active: Tested, you do : )
	▪	Fail 4,5,6 and your session will be invalidated,  The browser takes this and logs you out.
	•	 


=======================
Authentication Testing -
User attempts to enter code incorrectly 6 times and is Logged out
 

To Test: 
Re run the entire sequence as a complete fail
Check for browser status.  Is the browser still open and connected ??
Susan: Can we also check the user status user Admin Econnect.
