Ticket#: MPAY-865                     TestString: Atkmh007

Summary:  Make Payment Form | New Payee work flow duplicate NN warning is not showing

Description:
make payment , Add New Payee work flow.
first make note of one of the existing payee Nicknames.  Copy it , save it.

Click the +add Icon 
Execute through the standard new payee work flow.
Submit the Payment
See the Confirmation dialog.  Commit from confirmation, get the Success Dialog

In the Payee Nickname field enter the value first made note of (existing nickname string value) 
Tab out of the Nickname field, see the Save Payee Button be come active

Click the Save Payee Button

Expect:  An alert or warning of some kind.  Since this scenario was to exercise the uniqueness test, I would expect a notification in the dialog on this detail.

Actual:  Nothing on the Success dialog changes.  The Save Payee Button remains active after the click and the dialog does not close.

Assumption:  Alert or warning about failing Uniqueness of Payee Nickname is not getting through to the Success dialog

Ticket#: MPAY-854  1/21/16
Summary: Make Payment Form | Payee NickName Creation Dialog is being shown incorrectly

description
While using a Saved Payee with a Nick Name already in place the current implementation on QA 1/21/16 is forcing the Success Confirmation Dialog at the end of the payment process asking the user to add a NickName.


Login as adbrain_fps or as _CHAPS 
Use the Payees in place, Morty Smith or Rick Sanchez 
Execute a standard payment workflow Submit the payment 

Expect: Get the Confirm Payment Details only. 
Actual: Get the Confirm Payment Details and then get the Success ( with payee NN add field)

Ticket #: MPAY-819
Summary:  Make Payment Form | Confirm Payment Modal | Large string field Internal Reference over runs modal controls or runs off page
Pri : Major


Description
The make payments work flow text fields Payee Reference ( Optional ) and Internal Reference ( Optional ) allow 18 and 140 chars.  

Enter your data to make a payment.

Expect: The confirmation modal dialog to elegantly display the data there is limited room for.

Actual:  After committing data to these fields and submitting payment, the display in the Confirm Payment Modal Dialog is misaligned.  Payee ref 18 chars display the last char on the boundary separator.  The Internal Reference 140 chars will run off the page if there are no spaces in the 140 chars, or it will write over the ÒEditÓ & ÒSubmitÓ controls to complete the form.

See the attached screen shots

Ticket #: MPAT-817 Eric Pratt Edited a couple of fields on 817. 
Use 817 as he basic bug entry template.

Summary:
Invalid payment form state can be submitted

Description:
Launch https://qa4.svbconnect.com/auth/  
 Login as adbrain_(all,fps,back,chaps) and complete MFA
Navigate to URL É./payment/
Open Make payment form.
Enter valid date in the following fields.
Payee, Payment Type, Pay From Account,
Payment Amount, Payee Reference, Internal Reference.

With the Mouse Return to the Payment Amount field and put the cursor somewhere in the Amount field.
Enter a char, Sigh, digit.   
Immediately commit with the Enter / Return Key.

Expect: The invalid value to be caught and the form to be left in the Òyou must correct this error state"
Actual:  The Final Confirm Modal Dialog is displayed as if Success, and the error can be seen behind it.


Clicking either Edit or Submit in the Modal Confirm Dialog takes you back to the form for correction.

If during the creation of the error condition, the user tabs out of the erred Amount Field 
or if the user used the mouse and clicks the form Submit button, the Initial ERROR is caught.

This is a minor bug
This error condition is never sent to the back end.  The problem is cosmetic.
