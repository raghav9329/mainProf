https://longair.net/blog/2009/04/16/git-fetch-and-merge/
Was dealing with test numbers that didnÕt match Sonar.
Found that I was looking at master in all my repos instead of 
release/0.1.6 at this time.
so found that while on line in the office I could actually do
git branch release/0.1.6 and then I would be switched into that branch.
alsoÉ git branch -a  will list branches
also  git ls-remote will list the same info

!! I need to find out about remote-tracking branches



end.
