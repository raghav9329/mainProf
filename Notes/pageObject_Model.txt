Notes to cover my learning / understanding of this protramming pattern
As stated in 
https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects

I want my page object to present the services offerend by the objects I define.
I say, " by the objects I define.", because of functional blocking out of the app.
For Instance:  Starting the Browse-Buy or Shopping-Buy nature of our app.
There are two key things that need to be done before selecting a Plan.
1. provide the zipcode in Ca to base a plan about
2. the number dependents that will be on the plan
3. currently not implemented Birthday

So, I need an opening statement takes zipcode and dependents
model will expose: InitiatePlan(zipcode, dependents)
where zipcode should be a ZC in CA
Dependents should be between 0-15 ( or 14 )
0- will be your self
1 or more are what ever dependents you need
