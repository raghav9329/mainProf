edit /Systems/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist following inst above

find . -type f -name '*.php' -exec sed -i 's/    /\t/g' {} \;
Explanation:

find lists all files, one per line, in the current directory and all subdirectories recursively
. (period) means current directory
-type f only list files, not directories.
-name Ô*.phpÕ only if the name matches * (wildcard) with Ò.phpÓ at the end
-exec execute the following command for each result that matched
sed -i Ôs/    /\t/gÕ replace, or substitute, one string for another. IÕm searching for four consecutive spaces and replacing with t, meaning tab character. the /g at the end means global, replace each instance wherever it may appear in the file on each line. -i means Òedit file in placeÓ so the modified file is saved back to itself.
{} this inputs the file for the sed command
\; I think this finishes the -exec parameter for find. DonÕt forget the backslash

google:mac cmdline bash foreach example
http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-bash-for-loop-one-line-command/
Commands:
for i in {1..5}; do COMMAND-HERE; done
for((i=1;i<=10;i+=2)); do echo "Welcome $i times"; done
Files:
for i in *; do echo $i; done
for i in /etc/*.conf; do cp $i /backup; done



in order to get rid of the .DS_Store entry
in Git hub even when you have that entered
into ./.gitignore you need to do the following
git rm Ñcached .DS_Store

then commit and push
git status will no longer report it
