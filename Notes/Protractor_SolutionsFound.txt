G: protractor select from a dropdwn by text
I used the solution at 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19599450/how-to-select-option-in-drop-down-protractorjs-e2e-tests
Specifically element(by.cssContainingText('option', 'BeaverBox Testing')).click();
first var specification and then var.click()
This toatlly worked to get the dependents drop down quantity in the first dialog requesting a quote for plans ( zip specifies the location )
