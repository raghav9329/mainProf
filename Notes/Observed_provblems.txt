These are problems that donÕt warrant a bug, but if they repeated 


4/12/16:  having changed the payment cutoff time it was not picked up with a new login
Usually the value is set at 23:55.  I was setting at 22:30 and they then 22:45.

I saw it switch to 22:45 and then it went back to 22:30 and stayed there only switching to 
22:45 after another browser(this one Chrome ) logged in and go the right value.
