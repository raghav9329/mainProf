4/30/16 Jira Query: 
	•	In order to find the test cases that were involved in any SOA work or FlexCube workÉ..
project = "Murano Payments" AND Sprint in (closedSprints()) AND Type = Story AND( description ~"SOA" or summary ~"SOA"  or description ~"FC" or summary ~"FC" or summary ~"flex"  or description ~"flex") 
	•	That gave me a list of stories that had links to test cases.  The list of Jira tests was then
	•	queried for beloc

Project = "Murano Payments" and type = test AND (Issuekey = "mpay-1438" or issuekey = "mpay-1185" or issuekey = "mpay-336"  or issuekey = "mpay-404" or issuekey = "mpay-507"  or issuekey = "mpay-526" or issuekey = "mpay-566" or issuekey = "mpay-409" or issuekey = "mpay-408" or issuekey = "mpay-317" or issuekey = "mpay-316"  or issuekey = "mpay-315"or issuekey = "mpay-1028" or issuekey = "mpay-1026" or issuekey = "mpay-1025Ó   )
	•	Query output was then exportable to Excel.
	•	This excel sheet represented what was tested on SOA and FlexCube.


An incorrectly made Bug, can be modified to become a Story bug by using the Convert-To-Subtask feature.
In that work flow, It make you select the Parrent Issue ( story )
Select Sub-Task-Type selecting Story Bug.



NOTE: Sprint Workflow w.r.t the Jira Test Framework.
<<< I need to go over this with Eric.  >>>

Beginning of every sprint I need to make an execution and tie it to the sprint.
That way we can mark the tests as executed against the sprint  and later in a regression
make another regression_Execution and capture running the tests again.
