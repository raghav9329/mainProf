Question was raised on the previous meeting and it seems that we need to be on the same page about:
	•	what is encryption
	•	what is hashing
	•	what is symmetric and asymmetric encryption
	•	how fast and trusted they are
So, let me provide few simple articles from Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3

Now about the security, 3 articles attached, here is the public small part of the investigation/implementation, made for Data Lake protection of the retailer and for HDP platform improvement. Really hope that someday this solution will be the part of Hadoop/Hive.
ItÕs for your internal usage, because I still had no chance to publish them officially.

Some benchmarking here - https://github.com/yarnd/cryptotest-poc Yes, I invented the wheel and created own micro-benchmarking library, this was faster than read manuals on existing solutions and doubt on results.
