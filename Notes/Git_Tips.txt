Git_Tips


git checkout - - <pathtofile>   the two dashes are supposed to be closer together    
this will change the edits on the file back to unedited.

Question to be answered: Does it take it out of modified or out of staged ?


git log -2 <file>  puts out commit ID

git diff commitID <file>  will show the difference between <file> and the stat at commitID
