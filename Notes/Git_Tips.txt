Getting rid of continual .metadata and .recommenders and any other such filesÉ..
you need to add and commit every thing that you are interested inÉ.. 
source files text , what evvah!
This leaves behind all the Workspace .metadata/*  and workspace/project/.meta.. or recommendersÉ.  
With this stuff as the only that is reported in git status changes not staged for commit:
In this case they were all WorkSpace/.metadata/.* sooooÉ
I did #git rm -rf JavaDev/.metadata   but the command instructed at 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11451535/gitignore-not-working   had been git rm -r Ñcached
It was the instruction to a similar problem.
Removing the entire subdirectory from the REPO was EXACTLY what I really wanted to do.  I donÕt care about the metadata only the source


git checkout - - <pathtofile>   the two dashes are supposed to be closer together    
this will change the edits on the file back to unedited.

Question to be answered: Does it take it out of modified or out of staged ?


git log -2 <file>  puts out commit ID

git diff commitID <file>  will show the difference between <file> and the stat at commitID
