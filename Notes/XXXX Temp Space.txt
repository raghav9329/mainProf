Diana,

Hi there.  I hope you had a good weekend.

I'd like to lightly go over a few things, checking in.... 
and have you let me know what you know.

In my first week of being productive, ( my second week ) I was able to demonstrate functional test automation from beginning to end on the 5 page web app.  They had never seen that completed in the entire time the previous person was here.   Was this accomplishment or any other feed back reported to you ?

Since my first two weeks were completed over a week ago, does payroll have any road blocks that will keep me from receiving a direct deposit paycheck on the 27th ?  What time of day on the 27th will that check be deposited and available ?
 

Lastly, I'm having a really good time with this work and am keen to know any feedback you've received.


Thank you,

- Mark Atkinson
