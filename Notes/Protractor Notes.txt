Google: expect(browser.getCurrentUrl()).toEqual
which was just some code I was using regurlarly.  ( I"ve been tring to pin down nonAngular Wait For examples )
http://engineering.wingify.com/posts/angularapp-e2e-testing-with-protractor/
has some interesting points.  specifically
Angular is :  element(by.css('#elementid').click(); 
Non Angular would be : browser.driver.findElement(by.css('#elementid')).click();
which honestly is famaliar and maybe makes sense.

So, the question is.  Whey is this working ???
  var howManyWillBeCovered = element(by.id('coverage_type'));
  var commitSearch4Plans_go = element(by.id('btn_saveBig'));
  var firstEnrollButton = element(by.id('applyQuotesPage'));
