Phone number registration was a known and accepted problem in QA because we had CTV connectivity.  I was just forced to enter phone numbers for a user REGISTRATION Process.
It fails at the after clicking to have the text sent to my phone.  CTV works on this phone number.  Are there any thoughts on config or other possible solutions ?
