propulsion systems, and the opening section of </font><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch4.htm">chapter 4</a></font><font face="Geneva"> includes an assessment of this engine's technological
heritage. While the development of other engines discussed in Part
Three differed in specifics, the overall trends in their design,
test, and achievement of operational status paralleled that of the
H-1 and sprang from the same evolving technology. Introduced on the
Saturn V, the giant F-1 engine, while more akin to the conventional
cryogenics of the H-1, experienced many development problems. The
problem of scale affected many aspects of Saturn hardware
development, as the F-1 story attests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Application of liquid hydrogen
(LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">) technology constituted one of the key aspects of
Apollo-Saturn's success. The upper stages of the Saturn I and Saturn

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="89"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">89</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Development of
rocket engines was usually conducted several steps ahead of the
stage's tankage and the stage itself. This was done because of the
inherent complexities of propulsion systems and inherent difficulties
in engine research and development. Moreover, the choice of engine
propellants influenced many elements of stage design, including the
location of fuel and oxidizer tanks, propellant lines, and the
various subsystems involved in the interface between the engine and
stage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Much of the ultimate success of the Saturn
launch vehicles depended on the application of cryogenic
technology-the use of liquefied gases in propellant combinations. The
first-stage engines of the Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V
(respectively, the S-I, S-IB, and S-IC stages) used a noncryogenic
fuel called RP-1, derived from kerosene. All Saturn's engines used
liquid oxygen as the oxidizer, and the engines of the S-IV, S-IVB,
and S-II stages relied on liquid hydrogen as fuel. Put simply, the
ability to carry large amounts of cryogenic propellants meant much
more efficient launch vehicles. If designers had tried to build a
rocket large enough to carry gaseous propellants, the size and weight
of the tanks would have made it impossible to construct and launch
such a vehicle. With the gaseous propellants converted to a liquid
state, requiring less volume, designers had the opportunity to come
up with a design capable of getting off the ground. In the 1960s,
cryogenic technology experienced a phenomenal rate of growth and
state of development. In support of the space effort, scientists and
engineers accomplished a number of major breakthroughs, not only in
the field of cryogenics itself, but also in the design and production
of cryogenic rocket engines.</font></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">CRYOGENIC TECHNOLOGY</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The scope of cryogenics was neatly summarized
in a NASA report on cryogenics and space flight:</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Geneva">Cryogenics is the discipline, that
involves the properties and use of materials at extremely low
temperatures; it included the production, storage, and, use of
cryogenic fluids. A gas is considered to be cryogen if it can be
changed to a liquid by the removal of heat and by subsequent
temperature reduction to a very low value. The temperature range that
is of interest in cryogenics is not defined precisely; however, most
researcher consider a gas to be cryogenic if it can be liquefied at
or below -240°F. The most common cryogenic fluids are air,
argon, helium, hydrogen, methane, neon, nitrogen, and
oxygen.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.1">1</a></font></sup></b></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the early post-World War-II era, as the
United States' military services struggled to develop their own
stable of launch vehicles, they leaned very heavily on the German
wartime experience in technical areas
[<a name="91"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">91</font></b><font face="Geneva">] beyond the basic design of vehicles and rocket
engines. Although a reasonable amount of cryogenic technology was
available in the United States by World War II, there was little
experience in applying it to rocketry. Goddard's work in cryogenics
was apparently overlooked or inappropriate to the scale demanded by
the ICBM program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The development of the intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) required a host of subsidiary technological
advances, in such areas as cryogenic fluid systems, insulation,
handling and loading propellants, and large storage dewars. As some
American experts admitted later, "Initially, the basic V-2 cryogenics
data were used because the data constituted the sole candidate for
consideration at the time." Eventually, the United States built up
its own storehouse of cryogenic technology for rocket development.
The ICBM program and other research by civilian agencies prompted
greater interest for governmentally supported research, and the
Cryogenic Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards in Boulder,
Colorado, opened in 1952. By that date, cryogenics was firmly
established as an industrial and research discipline, ready to
support military requirements and the American space programs,
particularly in the 1960s.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.2">2</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">SATURN ENGINE
ANTECEDENTS</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The role of cryogenics in American launch
vehicles increased steadily, starting with the liquid-oxygen oxidizer
of the Vanguard first stage. Other rockets like the Redstone (and its
derivatives), Thor, Atlas, Titan I, and finally the Apollo-Saturn
series of launch vehicles-the Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V-used
cryogenic oxidizers, fuels, or both.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.3">3</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> As in so many engineering achievements, engine
development for the Saturn program represented the culmination of
earlier R&amp;D efforts, as well as the improvement of earlier
production items. The large vehicle boosters of the Saturn program
borrowed liberally from the accumulated engine technology of the
ICBMs and the intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) developed
for the military, particularly the Thor and Jupiter IRBM programs as
well as the Atlas ICBM.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.4">4</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The H-1 traced its general lineage to no less than
five prior designs: the control valves, gas generator system,
turbopump assembly, and thrust chamber derived specifically from
hardware applied in the Thor, Jupiter, and Atlas
engine.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.5">5</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Thrust increased dramatically, from the 120
000 newtons (27 000 pounds) of Vanguard's first stage in 1959 to the
33 000 000-newton (7 500 000-pound) first-stage booster of the Saturn
V in 1967. The fantastic jump in thrust levels was accompanied by
gains in the specific impulse (a measure of efficiency of a rocket
propellant, equal to the amount of thrust obtained per pound of
propellant burned per second), [<a name="92"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">92</font></b><font face="Geneva">] especially with the
introduction of liquid-hydrogen engines on the upper stages of the
Centaur and Saturn launch vehicles, a major achievement of the
American space program. Concurrently, advances were essential in a
number of supporting technologies-lightweight components, compact
packaging, materials application, and fabrication procedures.
Propulsion system designers and engineers accumulated considerable
experience along the way and refined various elements of the engine
for better operation and introduced more sophisticated components and
better control systems. Taken together, a myriad of improvements
through research and development after the end of World War II
contributed to higher levels of good engine design, with higher
specific impulses, thrust stability, and flexibility in operational
status.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.6">6</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">A review of engine advances achieved by the
mid-1960s can effectively characterize the accomplishments leading up
to the Saturn and highlight the innovations that were actually
incorporated into the Saturn propulsion systems. Problem areas, which
limited the desired performance of these engines, received special
attention from a wide variety of research programs. Many improvements
stemmed from the research programs carried out by industry. Many more
evolved from the cooperative efforts generated by NASA and the
various military services. The primary technological advances can be
summarized under the following categories: thrust chambers,
turbopumps, and system design and packaging.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THRUST CHAMBERS</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Many early liquid-propellant engines featured
a conical nozzle. Engineering improvements in thrust chambers were
aimed at more efficient shapes for increased performance and decrease
in weight. Designers sought higher performance through higher
area-ratio shapes with higher chamber pressures to minimize the size
and weight of the thrust chamber. In the drive to produce large,
high-pressure engines, a major hurdle was a satisfactory means to
cool the thrust chamber. An early solution used double-wall
construction; cold fuel passed through this space en route to the
combustion chamber, thereby reducing the temperature of the inner
chamber wall. But design limitations restricted coolant velocity in
the critically hot throat area of the engine. Thin-walled tubes
promised an ideal solution for the problem of the thrust chamber
walls. Tubes reduced wall thickness and thermal resistance and, more
importantly, increased the coolant velocity in the throat section to
carry off the increased heat flux there. As chamber pressures
continued to go up along with higher temperatures, designers
introduced a variable cross section within the tube. This
configuration allowed the tube bundle to be fabricated to the desired
thrust chamber contour, but variations in the tube's cross section
(and coolant velocity) matched the heat transfer at various points
along the tube. The bell-shaped nozzle permitted additional
[<a name="93"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">93</font></b><font face="Geneva">] advantages in reducing size and weight when compared
with what engineers called the "standard 15-degree half-angle conical
nozzle." Without any reduction in performance, the bell shape also
permitted a 20 percent reduction in length.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">TURBOPUMPS</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Advances in one area of the propulsion system
created demands on other parts of the system. As thrust levels and
pressures increased, so did demands on the turbomachinery to supply
propellants at greater flow rates and higher pressures. Problems
concerned the development of higher powered turbomachinery without
increases in size or weight. Advances in turbomachinery design
centered on higher speeds, and the goal of higher speeds encouraged
the introduction of rotating components with smaller diameters.
Essential subsidiary improvements dealt with high-speed bearings, the
performance of high-speed inducers, and higher speeds for the
impeller tips. Engineers succeeded in increasing the operating speed
of bearings through minute attention to details of the operating
environment and the fabrication of bearing parts. Designers
reconsidered and redesigned bearings for their optimum size, the
contact angle of surfaces touching the bearing, and the curvature of
the race structure. Better performance was gained by engineering the
newly designed bearings for combating contact fatigue and wear from
overheating. Further refinements included the introduction of new,
high-strength materials and improved surface finishes in the
fabrication of precision parts. The innovative use of the engine's
own propellants as "lubricants" was another advance. Although the
propellants were not lubricants in the usual sense, they served the
same purpose. The properties of the propellant-lubricants were more
important in carrying off frictional heat to keep pump bearings cool
and operable. This application simplified turbopump operation and
eliminated the need for externally supplied lubrication.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Engine designers also attacked propellant
cavitation, a condition in which the formation and collapse of
bubbles or vapor pockets while pumping the propellant caused
vibrations and damage to rocket machinery. Study programs found how
the cavitation characteristics were related to the inducer through
such minute factors as the angle of blades, taper, blade sweep, and
the profile of the leading edge. More accurate theories on the
phenomenon of cavitation enabled a redesign of the inducers that
doubled their suction. The overall increase in suction efficiency of
the turbopump permitted the pump to operate at higher speeds. This
contributed to weight savings in the vehicle because tank
pressures-and tank weight-could be lowered. The higher operating
speeds and pressures triggered development of pump impellers to
[<a name="94"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">94</font></b><font face="Geneva">] operate with higher tip speeds. The infusion of
high-strength materials, plus design improvements and fabrication
techniques paid off in reliability and greater speed. In total, all
of these developments enhanced the incremental gains in
power-to-weight ratios.</font></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">PACKAGING AND SYSTEM
DESIGN</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Over a brief span of time, the packaging and
design of cryogenic rocket engines made dramatic progress. The size
of the thrust chamber increased, while the "packaging" (pumps,
turbomachinery, and related systems) remained relatively constant or
actually decreased in physical size. At the same time, efficiency and
design advantages accrued. In the early Redstone days, builders
situated the turbopump, propellant lines, and controls above the
thrust chamber and achieved directional control by the use of jet
vanes. When gimbaled (movable) thrust chambers appeared on the scene,
the design limitations of pumps, lines, and other paraphernalia
dictated their attachment to the more solid footing of the vehicle's
thrust structure. With the thrust chamber as the only movable part of
the engine, engineers had to develop a new high-pressure feed line,
with great flexibility, to link the propellant pumps to the thrust
chamber. As the rise in chamber pressures and thrust levels put
increased strains on the high-pressure lines, designers began studies
of systems design and packaging to permit mounting the turbopomp and
associated gear onto the thrust chamber itself. In this
configuration, the pump and chamber could be gimbaled as a single
unit, permitting the installation of
[<a name="95"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">95</font></b><font face="Geneva">] low-pressure "flex lines" between the pump inlets and
the vehicle tanks. As it so happened, improvements in the design and
efficiency of turbomachinery already made it compact and reliable
enough to justify relocation on the thrust
chamber.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.7">7</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">PREDICTABLE ENGINE PROBLEM
PHASES</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In many ways, the H-1 was a composite example
of rocket engine development in the 1950s, modified and improved for
its role in manned launches of the Saturn I and Saturn Ib. Even
though the H-1 was derived from a propulsion system already in
production (the S-3D engine for the Thor and Jupiter), requirements
for increased thrust and generally improved performance led designers
and engineers into new and frustrating problems. The evolution of
both the H-1 and the F-1 engines fell into the pattern of many launch
vehicle development programs, in which the engines constituted the
pacing item.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.8">8</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Furthermore, the difficulties in engine design were
usually predictable, as Leonard C. Bostwick, a veteran MSFC engine
manager, knew all too well. "The development of liquid rocket engines
followed similar patterns regardless of engine size," he asserted.
Despite this ability of the engine managers to look with a crystal
ball into the future, ability to avoid all expected pitfalls did not
follow. "In the development of liquid rocket engines, problems occur
at several distinct intervals," Bostwick continued. "The type of
problem and the time phase can be predicted, but since the exact
nature of the problem cannot be so readily defined, a five to seven
year development program becomes a necessity."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.9">9</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> In general, an engine development program progressed
through four distinct problem phases" over the five- to seven-year
period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The designers of each successive generation of
rocket engines commenced their work with facts and figures
accumulated-often painfully-from earlier designs and experience. If,
however, the new engine was expected to perform better than the old
ones, the designers very quickly found themselves in uncharted
territory. They proceeded to push ahead of the state of the art,
seeking more flexibility in operations, greater simplicity, increased
thrust, and improved overall performance. At this point, Bostwick
pointed out, "The first problem phase occurs because of the inability
to totally extrapolate and build on existing knowledge." Just as
problems were predictable, so were the problem areas. Bostwick was
specific: "The problems will occur in the combustion mechanics,
propellant movement, or in the propellant control system." The
hardware evolved for this early development period often proved to be
less than adequate, and faults would sometimes not show up until the
engines moved past the initial firing sequence tests, perhaps in the
late tests to maximum projected duration and thrust levels. When the
[<a name="96"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">96</font></b><font face="Geneva">] problems then showed up, they were "often
catastrophic," Bostwick wryly observed. For this reason, the engines
were subject to extensive test programs to expose their inherent
frailties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Some time after the engine had successfully
passed qualification tests of the basic engine design, or even the
preflight rating trials, the second cycle of problems appeared. The
difficulties involved the mating of the propulsion systems to the
vehicle or stage. Because the development of the engines usually
preceded the development of the stage by two or three years, the
engines would not fit the mounting hardware and multitudinous
connections with the stage. In addition, there were the peculiarities
of late changes in the stage-engine interface requirements or
possibly in the operational environment introduced by new variations
in the flight plans. The stage contractors received prototypes or
preflight-rated engines and cooperated with the engine interface.
Inevitably, new sets of variables, which could not be anticipated
from mating with a nonexistent stage or for changes in mission
requirements, created problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As the engines phased out of the developmental
stage and into full production, MSFC personnel and the manufacturer
turned their attention to the third round of problems. They watched
the elements of quality control, tolerances in the manufacturing of
components, vendor selection, choice of manufacturing materials, and
definition of the integral manufacturing process. "A continuing
development program is planned during the period," Bostwick
explained, "to provide the trained personnel, facilities and hardware
capabilities to investigate these problems and to prove out the
required corrective effort.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Defying all these attempts to identify
potential failures, to uncover and correct weaknesses before a
multimillion-dollar vehicle left the launch pad, actual missions
inevitably uncovered a fourth set of problems, because there was no
way to duplicate the actual environment in which the vehicle had to
perform. With launch dates carefully scheduled ahead of time to
coincide with the launch "windows" and carefully paced to the
requirements of the Apollo-Saturn program, the problems uncovered by
one mission demanded a very fast response to keep the next phase of
the program on schedule. For this reason, NASA and the contractors
maintained a well-staffed cadre of specialists at the contractors'
engineering and test facilities, backed up by the facilities
available at MSFC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With the four major problem phases
successfully handled, the need for ongoing development and
engineering monitoring continued. "When engine systems are tested to
longer durations and more extreme limits," warned Bostwick, "problems
are uncovered that may have existed for a long time but were not
evident until the more severe testing on a larger engine sample
produced the failure mode." Other factors entered the picture too,
such as changes in process, improvements in manufacture, or
[<a name="97"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">97</font></b><font face="Geneva">] changes in vendors, any or all of which could create
a problem in quality of the hardware or introduce a different and
incompatible material."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.10">10</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Despite the best intentions of all concerned,
engine development and production encountered predicaments throughout
the duration of the Saturn program.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE H-1 ENGINE: MILESTONES AND
FACILITIES</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With requirements for the first generation of
Saturn launch vehicles established in general terms, planners began
to consider the development of propulsion systems. To save time and
money. NASA opted for an effort firmly rooted in existing engine
technology. The result was a decision to modify the Thor-Jupiter
engine, the 667 000-newton (150 000-pound) thrust S-3D and uprate the
engine to a thrust of 836 000 newtons (188 000 pounds). On 11
September 1958, NASA awarded the contract for the uprated engine to
Rocketdyne, the original supplier of the S-3D engines for Thor and
Jupiter. In the beginning, engineers designed the H-1 for a clustered
configuration to gain higher thrust than could be obtained from any
existing single engine. The basic concept featured four fixed inboard
engines and four outboard engines with gimbal mounts to provide
attitude control for the vehicle.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.11">11</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Although the original specifications called
for 836 000 newtons (188 000 pounds) of thrust, the first models were
delivered at 734 000 newtons (165 000 pounds) of thrust-down rated
for greater reliability. Eventually, the H-1 engine served the first
Saturn vehicles in four separate versions: 734 (165)-, 836 (188)-,
890 (200)-. and 912 000 newtons (205 000 pounds) of thrust. Saturn I
used the 734 (165) and 836 (188) engines in clusters of eight; Saturn
IB mounted eight units of the 890 (200) model in vehicles SA-201
through SA-205, with the 912 (205) model earmarked for SA-206 and
subsequent vehicles. The engines all had the same approximate
dimensions, standing 218 centimeters high, with a radius of 168
centimeters at the throat. The H-1 engines incorporated a
tubular-walled, regeneratively cooled thrust chamber. The propellant
was supplied by twin pumps, driven through a gearbox by a single
turbine, which was powered in turn by a gas generator burning a
mixture of the vehicle's main propellants.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.12">12</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Because the engine's basic design was kept to
existing components and propulsion systems, Rocketdyne got off to a
running start; the first 734 000-newton (165 000-pound) thrust
prototype came off the drawing boards, was put together in the
contractor's shops, and static-tested by 31 December 1958, less than
four months after the contract was signed. Development proceeded
rapidly; by the spring of 1960, NASA had performed the initial test
of the eight-engine cluster, and the H-1 passed the Preliminary
Flight Rating Tests by the fall of the same year. These
[<a name="98"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">98</font></b><font face="Geneva">] milestones demonstrated the basic ability of this
version of the H-1 to meet the flight requirements, and on 27 October
1961, vehicle SA-1 was launched successfully. Close on the heels of
the 734 000-newton (165 000-pound) thrust engine, NASA and Rocketdyne
initiated work on more powerful models; intended for later Saturn I
missions, the 836 000-newton (188 000-pound) version of the H-1 went
through its preliminary flight-rating test on 28 September
1962.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.13">13</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">For the S-IB first stage of the Saturn IB
launch vehicle, MSFC began studies for uprated engines with Chrysler,
the first-stage contractor. In November 1963, Chrysler returned its
analysis of engine load criteria and suggestions to mesh the
schedules for engines and stages. On this basis, MSFC directed
Rocketdyne to go ahead from the more powerful 890 000-newton (200
000-pound) thrust engine to a 912 000-newton (205 000-pound) thrust
system for the most advanced missions contemplated for the Saturn IB.
The schedule for engine deliveries stretched out through 1968, when,
on 30 June 1967, Rocketdyne signed a contract calling for a final
production batch of 60 H-1 engines, bringing the total number
purchased to 322.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.14">14</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Testing for the H-1 engine occurred in several
widely separated areas. Initial development took place in the
engineering facilities at Rocketdyne's main plant in Canoga Park,
California. In the nearby Santa Susana Mountains, the company used
one engine test stand, known as Canyon 3b, for early development
testing. For component testing, single-engine tests, and
clustered-engine tests, the H-1 program depended on facilities
located at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. Installations
at MSFC for H-1 development included a component testing laboratory,
a gas generator test stand, a single-engine test stand, and a
full-sized booster test stand for engine cluster tests. At
Rocketdyne's primary manufacturing complex for the H-1, located in
Neosho, Missouri, the company relied on existing installations for
manufacture and acceptance testing. Two dual-position test stands
were available, built for the original purpose of checking out
engines manufactured for Air Force missiles. A rental agreement,
negotiated by NASA and the Air Force, permitted Rocketdyne to use one
position on each of the dual stands.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.15">15</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE H-1 ENGINE: GENERAL
DESCRIPTION</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The models of the H-1 used in the Saturn I and
Saturn IB shared the same seven major systems: thrust chamber and
gimbal assembly, exhaust system, gas generator and control system,
propellant feed system, turbopump, fuel additive blender unit, and
electrical system. Production of the H-1 propulsion system involved
several design aspects unique to the Saturn program. For example, the
Saturn H-1 engine came out of Rocketdyne's shops in two slightly
different models. Each unit had a gimbal assembly for attachment to
the vehicle, but the inboard engines,
[<a name="99"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">99</font></b><font face="Geneva">] not required for thrust vector control, were
immobilized by struts which held them rigidly in place. The outboard
engines were equipped with gimbal actuators, attached to outriggers
on the thrust chamber, that produced the gimbaling action for
directional control for the vehicle. Basically identical, the inboard
and outboard engines possessed an additional physical difference that
necessitated a different label for each. The exhaust system varied
for the outboard and inboard engines, although both types mounted a
turbine exhaust hood, a turbine exhaust duct, and a heat exchanger
(with a coil system to convert liquid oxygen to the gaseous oxygen
required to pressure the oxygen tanks). The H-1C engine, the fixed
inboard unit, had a curved exhaust duct to carry the turbine exhaust
gases, and the H-1D engine, the gimbaled outboard unit, mounted a
unit known as an aspirator. The inboard engines simply ducted the
turbine exhaust overboard. The outboard engine exhaust was ducted
into collectors, or aspirators, located at the exit plane of the
nozzle. For the H-1D aspirator, designers chose a welded Hastelloy C
shell assembly, mounted on the outside of the thrust chamber and
extending beyond the thrust chamber exit plane. The aspirator
prevented the fuel-rich exhaust gases of the gas generator from
recirculating into the missile boat tail during flight. Instead, the
gases merged into the engine exhaust plume.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As developed for the Saturn program, the H-1
also shed a number of accessories carried over from the Jupiter
engine system. Early versions of the H-1 relied on the Jupiter's
lubrication system, which featured a 73-liter (20-gallon) oil tank.
The H-1 designers arranged for the vehicle's own fuel, RP-1 (along
with some additives), to do the same job. This arrangement eliminated
not only the oil tankage, but also a potential source of
contamination. The new approach required a fuel additive blender unit
as part of the engine system, tapping RP-1 fuel from the fuel
turbopump discharge system. During development, the H-1 shed other
remnants of its heritage from the Jupiter. A single-engine ballistic
missile needed complex thrust controls to ensure its accurate impact
on target. The Jupiter, perforce, carried considerable ancillary
baggage to accomplish its mission-pressure transducers, magnetic
amplifiers, hydraulic servo valves, and a throttling valve for the
gas generator and liquid oxygen. The H-1 engine, by contrast, relied
on simple, calibrated orifices within the engine, because thrust
control requirements were much less severe when individual engines
were clustered. In the Saturn, this permitted a marked simplification
of the H-1, accompanied by an attendant gain in
reliability.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.16">16</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="101"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">101</font></b><font face="Geneva">] ....combustion
instability (or combustion oscillation, at he called it), cracks in
the liquid oxygen dome, thrust chamber tube splitting, and problems
with the pump gears and bearings. Other difficulties made their
appearance, and each required a different kind of troubleshooting to
solve the case.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The term "combustion instability" described an
unsteady or abnormal combustion of fuel, a condition that not only
reduced engine performance, but could destroy the engine-and the
rocket as well. Within NASA and contractor circles, there was early
concern about the potential problem of combustion instability,
particularly in the uprated engines for Saturn I and the even larger
engines planned for the Saturn V. Investigators deliberately set out
to introduce combustion instability in the H-1 to see if the engine
could recover, and if not, redesign the engine to overcome this
potential danger. Late in 1963, a research group evolved a technique
to induce combustion instability. Workers fixed a special boss to the
face of the injector, and attached a small, 50-grain bomb to it.
Enclosed in a cylindrical nylon case designed for initial cooling by
engine fuel, the bomb was protected during engine start and run up
but soon heated up, and after a time, it ignited. The explosion
disturbed the combustion flame front sufficiently to create an
unstable operating condition. It was hoped that the injector could
recover from the instability in less than 0.1 second, but the
Thor-Atlas injectors, uprated to 836 000 newtons (188 000 pounds) of
thrust, failed to effect recovery in 8 of 16 bomb tests. After some
research and development work, designers rearranged the injector
orifices and added some baffles to the face of the injector. The new
design worked beautifully, giving satisfactory recovery at various
thrust levels and an unexpected bonus-an actual increase in engine
performance.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.17">17</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Another problem required changes in several
flight vehicles. While vehicle SA-7 was undergoing a series of leak
checks at Cape Kennedy in the fall of 1964, technicians came across a
crack in the LOX dome of an H-1 engine mounted on the first stage. An
investigation team traced the weakness to stress corrosion of the
aluminum alloy, which called for replacement of the domes on all
eight engines. Fortunately, a new type of aluminum alloy dome with
much higher resistance to stress corrosion had already been
developed. Rocketdyne also introduced a new dome manufacturing
process that included an additional heat treatment, as well as
additional machining of the finished part prior to the anodizing
process. The dome cracks henceforth disappeared.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.18">18</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Difficulties encountered with the tubular-wall
thrust chamber exposed some of the problems encountered in the
process of uprating a proven engine system to higher thrust levels,
from 734 000 newtons (165 000 pounds) of thrust to 836 000 newtons
(188 000 pounds) of thrust. Early in 1962, test engineers reported an
alarming frequency of longitudinal splits in the tubes of the
regeneratively cooled thrust chamber. Not only
[<a name="102"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">102</font></b><font face="Geneva">] was this condition a hazardous condition and a
hindrance to engine performance, but investigators also suspected
that problems of combustion instability could be traced to fuel
spraying embrittlement of the nickel-alloy tubes, a shortcoming that
did not appear in the 734 000-newton (165 000-pound) engine because
it operated at lower temperatures. In the hotter operating regimes of
the 836 000-newton (188 000-pound) thrust engine, researchers
discovered that sulphur in the kerosene-based RP-1 fuel precipitated
out to combine with the nickel alloy of the thrust chamber tubes. The
result: sulphur embrittlement and failure. The "fix" for this
deficiency in the new uprated engine involved changing the tubular
thrust chamber walls from nickel alloy to stainless steel (347
alloy), which did not react with sulphur.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.19">19</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At frequent intervals, MSFC and contractor
personnel met together to discuss such problems and to consider
solutions. At one such meeting, on 1 December 1966, the debate turned
to three recently developed problems and included continuing
consideration on a report about miscreant materials used in the
manufacture of turbine blades. Convening in the conference room of
the Industrial Operations Division of MSFC, the participants included
technical personnel and management representatives from MSFC,
Chrysler (the stage contractor), and Rocketdyne (the engine
contractor). Chrysler and Rocketdyne led off the session, with
commentary about the discovery of a dozen chunks of Teflon material
behind the injector plate of No. 4 engine on the S-IB-7 stage.
Workers at Chrysler (who had first discovered the problem) gathered
up the 12 shards of Teflon and pieced them together into a flat shape
about 5 centimeters square, with some nondescript markings.
Representatives from Rocketdyne's Neosho facility, where H-1
manufacturing was concentrated, went to work to discover the origin
of the intruding flotsam. While this analysis progressed, related
data hinted at similar anomalies in other engines of vehicle S-IB-7.
The Rocketdyne spokesman presented data on engine No. 4 that revealed
differences in its performance during recent static testing as
compared with previous testing-no doubt because of the Teflon pieces
obstructing the propellant flow. Rocketdyne was now concerned about
two more engines. The No. 8 engine had performance data that
paralleled No. 4 in some respects, suggesting a second Teflon
interference problem, originating from one of the liquid-oxygen
tanks. Moreover, the plumbing sequence in S-IB-7 caused the conferees
to suspect that loose pieces of Teflon, originating from a particular
liquid-oxygen tank, could also be lodged in the No. 5 engine system
as well. The conference group agreed that engines No. 5 and No. 8
posed potential dangers and should be detached and opened up for
thorough inspection, despite the impact on launch schedules.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Luckily, soon after the conference, Solar
Division of the International Harvester Company, an H-1 subcontractor
for valve components and other fittings, found the source of the
Teflon pieces. During some of [<a name="103"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">103</font></b><font face="Geneva">] its welding
operations, Solar used Teflon buffers to protect the weld piece from
abrasions caused by clamps. In fabrication and welding of flexible
joints in the liquid-oxygen line, Solar surmised, one of the Teflon
buffers could have slipped inside the line. They presented a sample
of the buffer, which had the tame general markings, size, and shape
as the original culprit. With the source of the problem localized,
MSFC and contractor officials agreed to call off the plans to inspect
the other engines, and the case of the Teflon intrusion was closed,
although some stricter fabrication and handling procedures went into
effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The December 1966 conference took up other
details affecting the Saturn program, such as steel filings that
lodged, thankfully, in the mesh filter of the lubricating system for
No. 6 engine sometime during short-duration firing tests on S-IB-8.
The safety screen had done its job. Still, the discovery of loose
filings anywhere in the Saturn's lubrication system or propellant
system raised the specter of disaster. Chrysler, the stage
contractor, was charged with finding the source of the loose filings.
The conference also discussed a frozen turbine shaft of the No. 6
engine on S-IB-8. After a round of charges and countercharges, the
group found that personnel from all three parties involved
(Rocketdyne, Chrysler, and NASA) had conducted an engine test without
conforming to written procedures. Conference officials agreed on
closer enforcement and possibly new guidelines to prevent
recurrences.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.20">20</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The final problem taken up by the December
1966 meeting-the turbine blades-involved the inadvertent substitution
of the wrong material during manufacture. During a "hot test"
(actually firing the propellants) on a Saturn IB first stage, one of
the H-1 engines experienced failure of turbine blades. After the
engines were removed and dismantled, the defective blades were found
to have been cast from 316 stainless steel rather than the Stellite
21 material specified in the production orders. An error at Haynes
Stellite (a division of Union Carbide) created the mix-up. Although
the quality control procedures employed x-ray analysis of each blade
for flaws, penetration of welds, and differences in materials in a
production batch, the x-ray check could not catch this particular
mistake if all the blades were of the wrong material. Revelation of
the error came late in 1966, when the Haynes Stellite plant in
Kokomo, Indiana, was in the grip of a strike. The strike, of course,
made communication between MSFC and Haynes Stellite personnel more
difficult. Concern about the substandard turbine blades extended
beyond NASA-the slip probably extended to blades in engines supplied
for Thor and Atlas missiles. The turbine blade imbroglio not only
compromised the Apollo-Saturn program, it shadowed the capabilities
of the national defense as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Knowing that defective blades existed in H-1
and other engines, investigators from Rocketdyne and MSFC went to
work devising a system to identify the culprits without pulling all
eight engines from every S-IB [<a name="104"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">104</font></b><font face="Geneva">] stage in the NASA
stable, as well as military missiles, and laboriously tearing them
down for lab analysis. As the strike at Haynes Stellite persisted,
NASA and MSFC relied on official leverage to get representatives from
Rocketdyne into the Haynes Stellite plant to find out what really
happened. To the limit of its ability under the circumstances, Haynes
Stellite cooperated, and the company itself came up with an "eddy
current" machine to help in the detective work. Properly calibrated,
this handy unit could differentiate between Stellite 21 material and
the undesirable 316 stainless steel. Applied to Saturn propulsion
systems, the investigation tracked down 10 H-1 engines with alien
turbine blades. Workers pulled all 10 engines from the stages and
replaced the turbine wheels with new units, followed by a hot fire of
each repaired engine to verify its performance and reliability. In
addition to preventive measures instituted at Rocketdyne and MSFC,
the contractor added to the inspection procedures an identification
by alloy type of each mold that was poured and set up reference
standards to catch variations in density during the x-ray
examination. In addition, every blade was tested for hardness, and a
sample of the vendor's shipments of turbine blades was subjected to a
wider array of metallurgical tests.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.21">21</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With this kind of quality control and
inspection, the H-1 engines experienced only one serious problem in
15 launches of the Saturn I and Saturn IB. During the flight of SA-6
in May 1964, one engine shutdown prematurely. The vehicle's
"engine-out" design proved its worth, as the mission continued to a
successful conclusion. Based on information transmitted during the
flight, analysts located the failure in the power train, "somewhere
between the turbine shaft and the C-pinion in the turbopump." The
incident was not entirely unexpected: prior to the flight, a product
improvement team had already developed an improved power train
design. In fact, starting with vehicle SA-7, the new units had
already been installed.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.22">22</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The development of the H-1 represented a case
study of predictable engine problem phases, as outlined by MSFC
engine specialist Leonard Bostwick. True to form, the larger F-1
experienced similar growing pains. If these travails seemed more
acute, they reflected the size of a much more substantial
engine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">.....Rocketdyne in 1959, calling for an engine
with a thrust of 6.7 million newtons (1.5 million pounds), was a
significant jump beyond anything else in operation at the time.
Executives within the space program looked on the big engine as a
calculated gamble to overtake the Russians and realize American hopes
for manned lunar missions. It seemed within the realm of possibility
too, by using engine design concepts already proven in lower thrusts
and by relying on conventional liquid oxygen and RP-1
propellants.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.23">23</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The F-1 engine had roots outside NASA: the big
booster came to the space agency in 1958 as part of the Air Force
legacy. The F-1 engine, developed by Rocketdyne, dated back to an Air
Force program in 1955. NASA carefully husbanded this inheritance
during the transfer of projects to the fledgling space agency, so
that no inconsiderable amount of Air Force expertise, along with
voluminous reports, came with the engine. NASA then conducted its own
feasibility studies and Rocketdyne received, in effect, a follow-on
contract in 1959 to step up work on the gargantuan propulsion
system.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.24">24</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At that time, no vehicle existed to use the
F-1. In fact, no designated mission existed either. Even though
engine development was undertaken with no specific application in
mind, this approach was not unprecedented. The complexities and
uncertainties in the evolution of propulsion systems encouraged their
prior development. This situation, while not out of the ordinary, did
lead to some of the first design problems of the F-1. When Boeing was
selected as prime contractor for the first stage of an advanced
version of the Saturn in December 1961, the configuration
[<a name="106"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">106</font></b><font face="Geneva">] of the vehicle was still uncertain. Not until 10
January 1962 did NASA confirm that the advanced Saturn (named Saturn
V in February) would have a first stage (the S-IC stage) powered by
five F-1 engines. Since the engine's application was not known at
first, designers and engineers tried to anticipate reasonable
requirements, at the same time keeping the nature of the interface
features as simple as possible. The eventual interface between
vehicle and engines required changes, however, and this aspect of the
F-1 resulted in redesign to eliminate problems unintentionally built
into the original model.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.25">25</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The original Air Force prospectus in 1955
called for an engine with a capability of 4 450 000 newtons (1 000
000 pounds) of thrust or more. Various studies went into comparisons
of single engines and clustered engines in terms of their
availability and reliability. Parallel studies included detailed
consideration of engine subsystems to operate at thrust levels of 4
450 000 newtons (1 000 000 pounds) and up. By 1957, Rocketdyne had
produced full, detailed analyses of a 4 500 000-newton (1 000
000-pound) thrust engine, and had also produced some models of
components for the big engine, as well as a full-scale thrust
chamber. In fact, work progressed so well that Rocketdyne began the
first attempts to demonstrate main-stage ignition during the same
year. The company's work on the F-1 received a big boost from a new
Air Force contract awarded in mid-1958. This document called for
Rocketdyne to proceed with the design of a 4 500 000-newton (1 000
000-pound) thrust engine, paralleled by the development of
appropriate new fabrication techniques, and capped by running initial
tests for a thrust chamber and injector components. Including the
prior effort, Rocketdyne had attempted several firing tests of the
full-sized thrust chamber between 1957 and 1958. In January 1959,
Rocketdyne's NASA contract included requirements for a series of
feasibility firings of the new F-1 booster; two months later the
engine hinted at its future success with a brief main-stage ignition.
The trial run demonstrated stable combustion for 200 milliseconds and
achieved a thrust level of 4 500 000 newtons (1 000 000 pounds). In
conducting these tests, Rocketdyne used a solid-wall "boiler-plate"
thrust chamber and injector-a far cry from flight hardware-but the
unheard of mark of 4 500 000 newtons (1 000 000 pounds) of thrust had
been reached by a single engine.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.26">26</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Engineers quickly sketched out the dimensions
and general configuration of the big new propulsion system, drawing
on their prior experience under the aegis of the Air Force and the
results of the early "hot" test of preliminary components. At Edwards
Air Force Base, where much of the early F-1 research had been
accomplished, Rocketdyne unveiled the first full-scale F-1 mock-up on
Armed Forces Day, 1960. Edwards continued as the center for
full-scale engine testing. Basic research, development, and
manufacturing took place at Rocketdyne facilities in Canoga Park,
California, and many component tests were conducted at the company's
[<a name="107"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">107</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Santa Susana Field Laboratory in the mountains
nearby. The company lost little time in getting started on real
engine hardware. Full-scale tests on the engine's gas generator began
in March 1960, and testing of the prototype turbopomp got under way
in November of the same year. Given the size and cost of the F-1
program, component testing represented an important practice-a
technique that Rocketdyne continued to refine during the development
phase of the total propulsion system. This "piecemeal" approach
avoided the costs and complexities, as well at months of delay, that
would have resulted from using the total engine system for the
initial tests. Company personnel also conducted "component extended
limits" testing, which called for the hardware under test to be
pushed beyond its normal performance specifications to establish
comprehensive guidelines of reliability and confidence. This concept
proved to be so successful that Rocketdyne applied the same extended
limits test concept to other engine test programs in progress.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The ability to put components like the gas
generator and turbopump through test runs so quickly brought
compliments from NASA's engine program managers at MSFC, who
appreciated the problems connected with testing such an oversized
propulsion system. Rocketdyne personnel pulled off another coup; they
not only conducted tests on many full-scale components within a year
of the initial contract, but on 6 April 1961, only 27 months from
start, they went through a test run of a full-sized thrust chamber
assembly prototype at Edwards Air Force Base. During the run, the
thrust of the prototype chamber peaked at 7 295 000 newtons (1 640
000 pounds) of thrust-an unprecedented achievement for
liquid-propellant rocket engines. Even with the advantages of the Air
Force research effort, this was a noteworthy record of
accomplishment.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.27">27</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> But a good many predicaments-and sophisticated test

PROBLEMS</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The story of the F-1 development embodied an
apparent contradiction: an awesome advance in engine performance and
thrust, but an advance based on conventional rocket propellants
(liquid oxygen and RP-1) and the existing state of the art. Designers
and engineers, whether at government installations or at contractor
plants, always had to remember the official NASA admonition about the
F-1: keep within the framework of past experience concerning the
liquid-fueled rocket engines. Joseph P. McNamara, a top executive at
North American and early general manager at Rocketdyne, remarked that
the F-1 was really "a big dumb engine" when compared to some of its
contemporaries that burned exotic fuels and featured more
sophisticated features. Still, it was big. Despite its thoroughly
conventional lineage, it was still a major step forward in rocket
engine technology. "The giant stride in thrust was to be
[<a name="108"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">108</font></b><font face="Geneva">] the major design advancement," said William Brennan,
a top Rocketdyne executive. The very size of the engines portended
some challenges. MSFC conceded that making "an enlargement of this
magnitude is in itself an innovation."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.28">28</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The scale of the engine always seemed to
threaten the goal of keeping the system old-fashioned" rather than
creating a daring new concept. For example, NASA continually
emphasized engine reliability because of its intended use for manned
missions. In this context, NASA limited the options for fuel and
oxidizers for the F-1 to proven types- liquid oxygen and RP-1-and
stressed the greatest simplicity in overall engine design. This
approach in turn dictated the incorporation of proven component
designs wherever possible, combined with advanced metallurgy for
added reliability. Once designers got into advanced metallurgy, they
got into innovation. Coupled with the factors of size and operating
requirements of the F-1, there ensued a number of technological
advances and innovations in fabrication techniques.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Despite the accelerating tempo of
technological advances in other rocket engines during the development
of the maturing F-1, its teething troubles multiplied. Several
factors affected early schedules. In the first place, testing
programs for the oversized F-1 required new facilities, which had to
be constructed. Test equipment had to be compatible with the
king-sized proportions of the F-1 test complexes. The design and
fabrication of the test equipment alone, in the judgment of MSFC,
constituted a "major development." Second, the size of the thrust
chamber called for a new brazing process for joining the propellant
tubes together. Third, the goal to simplify the engine and related
systems resulted in considerable new work to rely on the vehicle's
own fuel at high pressure to operate the engine control systems. In
eliminating the original plans for a separate hydraulic system, some
important redesign had to be done. A fourth area of extra effort
stemmed from the extraordinary rate of propellant consumption of the
engine (which reached three metric tons of fuel and oxidizer per
second). The development of components to meet such demands involved
very steep hardware costs and necessitated stringent procedures to
obtain maximum use of data acquired from each test. Finally, the
application of the F-1 in manned flights created additional
requirements for reliability and quality control above the limits
normally established for unmanned vehicles. So, despite all the
effort to rely on proven systems and components, a distinctly
different kind of engine development story emerged. As acknowledged
by the manager of the MSFC Engine Program Office, "the development of
the F-1 engine, while attempting to stay within the state of the art,
did, by size alone, require major facilities, test equipment, and
other accomplishments which had not been attempted prior to F-1
development."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.29">29</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="109"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">109</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Fabricated as a
bell-shaped engine with tubular walls for regenerative cooling, the
F-1 had an expansion area ratio of 16 to 1 (with nozzle extension)
and a normal thrust of 6 670 000 newtons (1 500 000 pounds). All
engines were identical except for the center engine in each Saturn V,
which did not gimbal. To accomplish its mission, the F-1 relied on
several subsystems, including the thrust chamber assembly (with the
injector and other hardware as integral parts), the turbopump, gas
generator system, propellant tank pressurization system, control
system, flight instrumentation system, and electrical system.
Additional paraphernalia, such as the thermal insulation blankets,
were finally adopted as part of the overall F-1 engine propulsion
system.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.30">30</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At nearly every step of the way, the unusually
large engine exhibited growing pains, and each component required
special design attention in one form or another. In some cases, these
problems were unanticipated; but even when designers expected a
difficult development period, the solutions did not come easily. Such
was the case with the F-1 injector.</font></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE F-1 INJECTOR</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The injector sprayed fuel and oxygen into the
thrust chamber, introducing it in a pattern calculated to produce the
most efficient combustion. To the casual observer, the final
production model looked simple enough. The face of the injector, or
the combustion side, contained the injection orifice pattern,
determined by alternating fuel rings and oxidizer rings, both made
from copper. Across the face of the injector, designers installed
radial and circumferential copper baffles. These baffles extended
downward and divided the injector face into a series of compartments.
Along with a separate fuel igniter system, the Injector and baffles
were housed in a stainless steel body.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In operation, the liquid oxygen dome, or LOX
dome, located atop the thrust chamber assembly, channeled oxidizer
directly into the injector. Fuel injection followed a somewhat more
indirect route, entering the injector from the thrust chamber's fuel
inlet manifold. As a means of ensuring the engine start and operating
pressure, part of the fuel flowed directly into the thrust chamber,
but the remainder was channeled by alternating tubes down the length
of the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, then back up again
through the remaining tubes. The fuel entered a fuel collector
manifold, consisting of 32 spokes leading to the injector. Finally,
the fuel squirted through 3 700 orifices into the combustion chamber
to mix with the oxidizer, which entered through 2 600 other orifices
in the injector face.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Obviously, the injector demanded rigorous
design work for tolerances and durability under extreme heat and
pressures. At Rocketdyne,..... </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">....the outset, it might have seemed logical
to scale up designs successfully developed for smaller engines.
However, development of a stable injector for the 1 780 000-newton
(400 000-pound) thrust E-1 engine required 18 months, and it seemed
more than likely that the 4.5-million-newton (1.5-million-pound) F-1
would require something more than just a "bigger and better" design
concept.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Rocketdyne's ability to run injector and
thrust chamber tests with full-scale hardware in March 1959, only two
months from the date of the original contract, derived from its
earlier Air Force activities. Some experimental hardware was already
on hand, and Rocketdyne also had a usable test stand left over from
prior experiments. The first firings were made with components
several steps removed from what could be expected as production
models. Because the injector paced so much of the overall design and
because designers and engineers wanted to start as
[<a name="112"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">112</font></b><font face="Geneva">] soon as possible, the thrust chamber tests used
rough, heavy-duty hardware; it was cheap, and it was easy to work
with.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Investigation began with a critical review of
all prior operational injector work and current experimental studies
to develop a promising avenue of design for the new component.
Advanced theories were needed to understand the operation of an
injector at much higher densities and higher chamber pressures than
ever attempted. As a result of this preliminary theoretical work, the
F-1 injector evolved as a construction of copper rings. This promised
the necessary structural rigidity, resistance to localized hot spots,
and overheating at the injector face.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With a heavy-duty component in hand, the
design work progressed to the next stage of design assessment,
featuring a series of water-flow and calibration tests. These
procedures verified spacing and shape of injector orifices. The next
step involved statistics derived from the flow and calibration tests,
giving engineers the kind of data they needed to plan appropriate
start sequences for the injector and engine system. The culmination
of these investigations occurred in the first hot tests, "one of the
most critical stages in an injector development program." These trial
runs late in 1960 and early in 1961 marked Rocketdyne's first wave of
troubles concerning stability of the injector at rated thrust level
for duration firing.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.31">31</a></font></sup></b></p>

INSTABILITY</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At the outset, planners considered three
different injector designs, all of them more or less based on the H-1
injector configuration. "However, stability characteristics were
notably poorer," reported Leonard Bostwick, the F-1 engine manager at
MSFC. "None of the F-1 injectors exhibited dynamic stability." Once
instability got started in the engine, nothing stopped it until the
test engineers cut off the propellants and shutdown the entire
engine. Obviously, this was not the way to successful missions. The
design team tried variations of baffled injectors and flat-faced
injectors with little improvement, except that the flat-faced designs
could be expected to create more damage than their counterparts with
baffles. Finally, all hands agreed that the attempt to scale up the
H-1 injector to the F-1 size just would not work. There were too many
variables: high chamber pressures, a lower contraction ratio, greater
density requirements for the injector, and much larger diameter of
the thrust chamber. With the concurrence of MSFC, Rocketdyne began a
new path of investigation to select an injector design with
inherently stable combustion characteristics.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.32">32</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The snags in the F-1's progress sharpened
high-level skepticism about the feasibility of an engine the F-1's
size. During a meeting of the [<a name="113"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">113</font></b><font face="Geneva">] President's Science
Advisory Committee early in 1961, one member, Donald Hornig,
reportedly expressed strong reservations about the F-1 engine program
because of fundamental problems in its development, adding that it
might just be too big to make it work. Hugh Dryden, NASA's Deputy
Administrator, got wind of these comments and wrote to Hugh Odishaw,
of the National Academy of Sciences, to help set the record straight
in the scientific advisory community. Dryden reported encouraging
progress on new injector designs and characterized the tribulations
of the F-1 as inevitable in engine work. "Such development problems
are the common experience of every engine development with which I am
familiar and are nothing to be concerned about," he counseled, "so
long as one makes sure that the developing agency is taking a
multipronged approach to obtaining a solution."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.33">33</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Several new radial injector designs now become
candidates for the F-1 engine. To acquire more accurate data,
engineers ran tests with scaled-down models in a special
low-pressure, two-dimensional transparent thrust chamber. This
permitted the use of high-speed photography and "streak movies" to
analyze the performance of the injectors in simulated operation. The
most promising designs graduated to full-sized models in hot-fire
tests which included bomb experiments (as in the H-1) and erratic
propellant flows produced by an explosively driven piston. The new
designs appeared to have combustion instability, an early concern,
under control until 28 June 1962, when combustion instability
resulted in the total loss of an F-1 engine. From there on, as von
Braun drily remarked, "This problem assumed new
proportions.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.34">34</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Working quickly, MSFC established a combustion
stability ad hoc committee, chaired by Jerry Thomson of Marshall,
with six permanent members and five consultants chosen from MSFC,
Lewis Research Center, the Air Force, industry, and universities. The
group got together at Huntsville on 16 July to consider the recent
loss of the F-1 engine and to review Rocketdyne's R&amp;D efforts, as
well as to provide technical assistance and coordinate all research
on the problem. Rocketdyne had established its own stability council
by the autumn of 1962 to pursue the issue of F-1 instability and also
enlisted the support of leading authorities from government and
universities. Rocketdyne's group was headed by Paul Castenholz and
Dan Klute, temporarily relieved of their current duties for full-time
attention to combustion instability. They reported directly to
William J. Brennan, Rocketdyne's chief of propulsion engineering at
the time.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.35">35</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Reacting to deep concern expressed within the
Office of Manned Space Flight, von Braun prepared a memo in November
1962 to reassure Seamans and others at Headquarters. Von Braun
emphasized Marshall's concern and praised the steps taken by
Rocketdyne to deal with the situation, but promised no quick or easy
solutions. The memo from von [<a name="114"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">114</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Braun gave a clear
insight into the frustrations in searching for answers. Although
various organizations had pursued combustion-instability research for
the past 10 years, nobody had yet come up with an adequate
understanding of the process itself. Therefore, it had not been
possible to use suitable criteria in designing injectors to void
combustion instability. "Lack of suitable design criteria has forced
the industry to adopt almost a completely empirical approach to
injector and combustor development," von Braun said. This approach is
not only "costly and time consuming," he continued, but also"..."does
not add to our understanding because a solution suitable for one
engine system is usually not applicable to another." Von Braun urged
more extensive research on the task, and suggested that universities
in particular could put Ph.D. candidates to work on aspects of
combustion and combustion instability for their
dissertations.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.36">36</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the meantime, two more engines were lost in
tests. D. Brainerd Holmes wanted a special briefing on the problem,
which he received on 31 January 1963. At the end of the presentation,
Holmes commented that the goal of beating the Russians to the moon
seemed to be mired in F-1 problems. He asked if it was not time to
start work on a backup scheme. The briefing team, which included
representatives from MSFC and Rocketdyne, convinced Holmes that new
work would detract from solving F-1 difficulties, which appeared to
be succumbing to intensive government-industry engineering and
university research.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.37">37</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> In March, however, Holmes wrote to von Braun,
reemphasizing the need to get the F-1 effort on schedule to avoid
slips in launch dates and the lunar landing goal. "I regard this
problem as one of great seriousness," Holmes wrote, and asked to be
kept informed on a daily basis.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.38">38</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">It took 12 months for Rocketdyne to work out a
baffled injector design that functioned well enough to pass the
preflight rating tests. Some vexatious anomalies persisted, however,
especially in the injector's inability to recover from combustion
oscillations artificially induced by bombs detonated inside the
thrust chamber. This situation called for added research before the
F-1 could pass muster for the final flight-rated design. By July
1964, with combustion stability work continuing, Rocketdyne received
an additional contract of $22 million, including miscellaneous
hardware and services, with a special allocation to accelerate the
company's research in combustion stability.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.39">39</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Significant theoretical work was accomplished
by two Princeton researchers, David Harrje and Luigi Crocco, along
with Richard Priem of the Lewis Research Center. When Crocco was in
Europe on sabbatical during the academic year 1963-1964, he
maintained correspondence with MSFC; NASA Headquarters even approved
von Braun's request to send Rocketdyne and Marshall representatives
to talk with Crocco in [<a name="115"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">115</font></b><font face="Geneva">]
Rome.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.40">40</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> To investigate the phenomenon of unstable combustion,
engineers and researchers employed a wide range of instrumented
apparatus and other aids. Among other paraphernalia, investigators
introduced high-speed instrumentation to diagnose combustion in the
thrust chamber and to evaluate modifications to the original designs.
The exacting attention to details led to apparently minor changes
that actually proved to be of major significance. After careful
calculations of the effect, enlarging the diameters of the fuel
injection orifices was later judged one of the most important single
contributions to improved stability. Other careful changes included
readjustment of the angles at which the fuel and oxidizer
impinged.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.41">41</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Several techniques of rather dramatic nature were also
applied in the instability research. For the layman, the most bizarre
aspect of F-1 testing (like the H-1) involved the use of small bombs
to upset the thrust exhaust pattern to measure the engine's ability
to recover from the disturbance. By varying the size of the bombs,
test engineers could create instability of different intensities and
evaluate the ability of the engine to restore stable
conditions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">This procedure offered an immense saving in
time and costs, because it eliminated the old methods of running
hundreds of engine tests in an effort to acquire a quantity of useful
statistics. Moreover, the ability to artificially subject the F-1
injector to severe operational stresses eventually resulted in a
superior design with excellent damping characteristics. During early
tests, self-triggered instability continued for more than 1600
milliseconds-a highly dangerous condition. The successful design
recovered from deliberately triggered instability in less than 100
milliseconds. The final product included the redesigned orifices for
LOX and fuel to improve the distribution pattern of propellants as
well as a rearrangement of the injector baffles. The baffled
injector, as opposed to the flat-faced type, was particularly
effective in recovery during the deliberately triggered instability
tests. The minute, exacting requirements of engine development were
such that these seemingly insignificant changes required some 18
months to prove out, and the flight-rated model of the F-1 injector
did not receive MSFC's imprimatur until January
1965.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.42">42</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the course of F-1 engine development,
Rocketdyne personnel consistently emphasized the combustion stability
investigations as one of the company's stiffest challenges, and its
solution as one of its most satisfying achievements. Although
engineers expected difficulties in this area because big engines with
high chamber pressures inevitably developed random and unpredictable
combustion instability, the size of the F-1 dramatically increased
the size of the challenge. Rocketdyne managed to cope with the
problem, although, as Brennan admitted in an address to the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1967, "the
[<a name="116"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">116</font></b><font face="Geneva">] causes of such instability are still not completely
understood."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.43">43</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Even though the F-1 engine performed satisfactorily,
uncertainty concerning combustion instability persisted a decade
later.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch4.htm#n1">*</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Although combustion instability and injector
development became the pacing items in the F-1 program, other thrust
chamber problem areas required constant troubleshooting by Marshall
and Rocketdyne engineers. During the first half of 1965, MSFC
monitors at Rocketdyne's production facilities in Canoga Park,
California, were worried about cracks in the thrust chamber jacket,
while MSFC monitors at the Edwards Air Force Base test site were
frustrated by cracks in the thrust chamber tubes. Engine 014 had been
in and out of the test stand more than once for injector changes and
thrust chamber tube repairs. In April 1965, the MSFC monitor at
Edwards reported to Huntsville that the engine was back in the test
stand once more. "Engine 014 apparently has a dog of a thrust
chamber," he wrote in exasperation.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.44">44</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Another troubleshooting effort that required
considerable attention concerned a manufacturing sequence for the
injectors. Unhappily, the problem appeared after a number of engine
deliveries to the Boeing Company, the contractor for the S-IC first
stage of the Saturn V. The injector incorporated multiorificed copper
fuel and oxidizer rings, held by steel lands (rings) installed in a
stainless steel body. To attach the copper rings to the steel lands
of the injector body, workers performed a brazing operation. As test
runs on R&amp;D engines accumulated more and more time, the brazed
bond joint failed, with very bad separation between the copper rings
and steel lands. Analysis of all prior engine deliveries disclosed
similar minute failures. In a somewhat elegant solution, new
procedures called for replacements using gold-plated lands to offer a
superior bonding surface during brazing. During the spring and summer
of 1965, this investigation involved considerable testing and
metallurgical analysis, not only to pinpoint the problem, but to

injector or thrust chamber problems, another group labored on the
problem of pumping hundreds of thousands of liters of propellants out
of the S-IC's propellant tanks and into the five F-1 engines. The

feature required a special heater to keep the ball bearings from
freezing up when the pump was chilled by liquid oxygen prior to
engine start. The oxidizer pump, rated at 102 230 liters (24 811
gallons) per minute, supplied oxidizer to the thrust chamber as well
as to the gas generator. Oxygen entered the pump through an inlet
connected to the oxidizer tank by a duct, and the inlet had an
inducer mounted in it to increase the pressure of the oxidizer before
it reached an impeller. This sequence prevented cavitation in the
liquid oxygen stream. The impeller brought the oxygen to the correct
pressure, then discharged it through appropriate routes to the thrust
chamber and gas generator. With a rated capacity of 57 392 liters (15
741 gallons) per minute, the fuel pump supplied the thrust chamber
and gas generator in the same manner as the oxidizer pump. The fuel
pump system also employed an inducer section to prevent cavitation
before the fuel reached the impeller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The turbine to drive the separate propellant
pumps was an impressive piece of machinery itself-it developed 410
000 watts (55 000 brake horsepower). Designers located the turbine on
the fuel-pump end of the turbopump. In this position, the units of
the turbopump with the most extreme temperature differences
(816°C [1 500°F] for the turbine and - 184°C
[-300°F] for the oxidizer pump) were separated. Hot gases for
the turbopump turbine originated in the gas generator and entered the
turbine at 77 kilograms per second.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.47">47</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> A series of failures, 11 in all, dogged the
development of the turbopumps for the F-1 engine. Two incidents were
traced to structural failures of the LOX pump impeller, which called
for redesign of the unit with increased strength. Explosions occurred
in the other nine instances, with five during engine tests and four
during component tests of the turbopump. The explosions developed
from a variety of causes, such as shock loads due to high
acceleration of the turbopump shaft, rubbing between critical seals
and other moving parts, fatigue in the impeller section, and other
problems. With some new design work and manufacturing techniques,
these conditions disappeared, and investigators proceeded to cope
with other problems that continued to crop up, such as the engine
turbine. For the engine turbine manifold, Rocketdyne chose a new
material known as René 41. This material was quite new to the
manufacturers of rocket engines, and the welding process produced
cracks adjacent to the weld in the heat-affected zone created by the
welding pass. As a result, the company devoted considerable time and
effort to ascertaining proper welding conditions and to training
welders on the production lines. With the proper welding requirements
finally established, Rocketdyne adopted an automatic welding
procedure to complete the "fix" on this
situation.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.48">48</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The turbopump was a good example of the
emphasis on simplicity and reliability in design philosophy. "The
primary consideration in the selection of the turbopump design," MSFC
managers emphasized, "was to attain reliability by using a minimum
number of parts and proven [<a name="119"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">119</font></b><font face="Geneva">] design concepts."
Engineers were anxious to have a turbopump capable of operating at
low inlet pressures, both to simplify design requirements and to have
low pressure in the propellant tankage. The packaging concept of the
F-1 influenced the design of the turbopump system. The main
objectives in the engine configuration included designing components
to be as small as possible and keeping machinery as accessible as
possible. In general, the configuration of the engine package
followed the pattern of the Atlas sustainer engine (the S-4),
Rocketdyne's first large liquid-propellant gimbaled engine with the
turbopump mounted directly on the thrust chamber. Designers located
all other associated equipment on the turbopump, thrust chamber, or
somewhere in between. The attraction of this approach, as in the H-1,
lay in the ability to avoid flexing the high-pressure propellant
ducts in concert with the gimbaling engines during a launch.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The F-1 turbopump assembly featured a variety
of manufacturing techniques, heat treatment, and other processes to
impart the most desirable properties to the high-performance engines.
A good example of evolutionary steps in the process of engine
development, these aspects of the F-1 fabrication grew out of the
special materials programs associated with the H-1 engine. In both
cases, designers selected materials intended to provide extra margins
of safety whenever possible. For the pump's inlets, volutes, and
impellers, the F-1 incorporated a lightweight, but sturdy,
aluminum-alloy casting. For turbine wheels and manifold assemblies
that performed under higher operating temperatures, designers favored
a nickel alloy with high strength at high temperatures. After running
hundreds of tests on final designs of the F-1 turbopump assembly, its
developers were at last satisfied with the performance of the
materials chosen and the design philosophies that were
used.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.49">49</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE F-1 THRUST CHAMBER AND FURNACE
BRAZING</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At a rate of three metric tons per second (one
metric ton of RP-1 fuel and two metric tons of liquid oxygen), the
F-1 was designed to burn its propellants at approximately 79 000
newtons per square centimeter (1 150 pounds per square inch) at the
injector face (the high pressure was emphasized as a matter of
efficient design), and within the thrust chamber convert this furious
activity into a high-temperature, high- velocity gas with a yield of
4.5 million newtons (1.5 million pounds) of thrust.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Before entering the thrust chamber body tubes,
RP-1 entered the fuel manifold from two diametrically opposed inlets.
The bypass (which channeled about 30 percent of the fuel flow
directly to the injector) reduced the power requirement for the fuel
pumps-they did not have to force all the fuel down the cooling tubes
and up again to the [<a name="120"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">120</font></b><font face="Geneva">] combustion chamber.
The remainder of the RP-1 was diverted down through 89 tubes to the
nozzle exit, where a return manifold directed fuel back through the
89 return tubes. In the lower sections, the tubes were actually
bifurcated units. From the fuel mainfold down to the point where the
engine attained a 3.1 expansion ratio, the tubes were installed as
single pieces. Below that point, the manufacturing process included
two secondary fuel tubes, each spliced into the primary carrier.
Designers went to this configuration to compensate for the increasing
flare of the bell-shaped nozzle. The bifurcated units in the flaring
nozzle permitted the engine to retain a desirable cross-sectional
area in each tube and still achieve the wide, flared bell
shape.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.50">50</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Transforming the thrust chamber's individual
tubes into a vessel capable of handling the F-1 pressure and heat
required specialized metallurgical research in Rocketdyne
laboratories and at MSFC. To form the regeneratively cooled engine,
the F-1 was fabricated as "a tube bundle surrounded by a heavily
jacketed combustion chamber, a series of bands around the nozzle, and
two end rings." The basic thrust chamber included 178 primary tubes
and 356 secondaries, requiring 900 meters of brazed joints between
them to keep the combustion gases contained within the thrust
chamber. Rocketdyne personnel expended a great deal of effort on the
perfection of brazing operations required for the nickel-alloy thrust
chamber assembly; it was a major challenge to perfect an alloy and a
brazing technique to seal the hundreds of tubes together in a bond
that would withstand high temperatures and pressures. The joints
carried some of the stresses created by the expanding combustion
gases, but the jacket and reinforcement bands around the tube bundle
carried the primary load. This basic F-1 design reflected the
features of other regeneratively cooled engines with tubular walls,
such as the Atlas and H-1 engines. The greatly increased operational
factors of the F-1 required more sophisticated fabrication methods,
which led the company, finally, into the design and construction of
the largest brazing furnace of its type in the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the production of less powerful
liquid-rocket tubular-walled thrust chambers, usually of pure nickel,
manufacturing engineers depended on manual torch brazing with alloys
of a silver-based type. With the F- 1's thrust levels up to 10 times
those of prior engines, investigators knew that the old procedures
needed some rethinking if the big new engine was going to hold
together during a launch. For the tubes themselves, the nickel-alloy
Inconel X-750 provided the high strength-to-weight ratio that was
needed, but it imposed certain restraints in the brazing process.
After experimentation, designers realized that technical reasons
prohibited the conventional technique of torch brazing, and dictated
a furnace brazing process. Then a secondary set of problems cropped
up. Inconel X-750 included enough aluminum and titanium to form
refractory oxides under brazing temperatures, so that "the surface of
the Inconel is [<a name="121"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">121</font></b><font face="Geneva">] not readily wet by
most hazing alloys at elevated temperatures." Thus the brazing
procedures had to begin by electrolytically depositing a thin layer
of pure nickel on the tubes to eliminate the refractory oxides on the
brazing surface. Despite this minor drawback in the operation,
furnace brazing promised several distinct advantages over the torch
method by minimizing differences in thermal stresses, combining
age-hardening of the tubes with the brazing operation, and
eliminating the variables of hand methods.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.51">51</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With the furnace activated in 1965, furnace
brazing for F-1 production proceeded in several carefully regulated
sequences. After preliminary brazing operations to unite the thrust
chamber tubes and other components, the scene was set for the final
furnace brazing cycles to create a properly sealed thrust chamber.
Inside a "clean-room" area, workers assembled the complete thrust
chamber, using a special fixture devised by Rocketdyne to ensure
proper alignment of the tube bundle, jacket, and end rings. In
addition to the 900 meters of tube-to-tube alloy joints to be sealed
inside and outside, the exterior required some 7 000 tube-to-band
joints to be brazed. The brazing alloy, in a powder form, was applied
by workers using hand-held spray guns, an application technique also
especially developed by Rocketdyne.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Despite the highly refined and closely
monitored steps leading up to the first major furnace brazing
operation, this operation remained heavily laden with drama since it
could almost as easily go sour as succeed. As one Rocketdyne engineer
emphasized, "The furnace brazing operation represents a final step in
which all the material, time, and resources expended in the
fabrication of hundreds of thrust chamber parts and subassemblies are
committed. In many respects it is similar to the launch of the
vehicle itself, since failure of any one of the numerous controls
exercised during the furnace brazing operation could result in a
poorly brazed, unacceptable piece of hardware." No wonder, then, that
Rocketdyne expended so much attention on the furnace, which
incorporated several unique features of design and
performance.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.52">52</a></font></sup></b></p>

circumferential exhaust manifold collected the turbine exhaust gases
and directed them through the nozzle skirt into the engine's exhaust
plume. The skirt was designed with double walls, and numerous slots
in the wall allowed the gases to exit with the jet stream of the
exhaust. The effect was to introduce a cooler boundary layer to
protect the walls of the thrust chamber extension. With

<p><font face="Geneva">....disposal of the turbine exhaust gases into
the thrust chamber by way of the nozzle extension, Rocketdyne
designers realized the advantages of a neat, comparatively
lightweight system. There was no need for extra attachments such as a
turbine exhaust duct, and the extension favorably increased the
expansion ratio. Designed with simple bolted attachments, the
extension could be conveniently removed for shipping and handling of
engines and stage. The simplicity of the design allowed the engine to
be easily test-fired following reattachment of the nozzle skirt at
the test site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">To help keep the S-IC propellant tanks under
pressure, the engine contractor supplied elements of the propellant
tank pressurization system. The key to the system was the heat
exchanger, which heated gaseous oxygen and helium to pressurize the
oxidizer tank and fuel tank, respectively. Using the vehicle's own
oxidizer as part of the propellant tank pressurization system
illustrated harmoniously integrated design of many of the rocket
systems and subsystems. Another good example involved the use of the
fuel as the fluid medium in the hydraulic control system. The
hydraulic design itself constituted a notable design advancement for
an engine the size of the F-1. The system cut out many sets of
[<a name="123"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">123</font></b><font face="Geneva">] previously required pneumatic controls and electrical
components and automatically increased reliability. Once the fuel
used as the hydraulic fluid had performed its programmed chores in
engine components, a myriad of tubing routed it back to the turbopump
fuel inlet fur combustion in the thrust chamber.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The frustrations of perfecting an engine the
size of the F-1 ran the gamut from internal hardware to external
accessories. The high operating temperatures of the engine called for
varied insulation at many points, and the super-hot blasts from the
clustered engines created the need for special insulation to protect
the engines from their own exhaust. During the vehicle's ascent, the
plumes from the five F-1 engines expanded with decreasing ambient
pressure until they become one searing, gargantuan sheet of flame,
and a backlash stream of hot gases played over all the exterior
surfaces of the engines. For this reason, designers had to protect
the engines from thermal attack during the flight, as well as
consider the high heat radiation encountered as the engines built up
to mainstage thrust levels at liftoff. Thus, the F-1 engine acquired
its distinctive external insulation "cocoon," molded into segments
and attached to the engine with brackets. Despite its deceptively
simple appearance, the development of this insulation cocoon also
experienced its share of problems in attachment and weight.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Engineers employed a direct and brutal method
to test the engine insulation cocoon installed on the F-1. Workers
placed an engine, enclosed in its protective wraps, inside a special
wind tunnel. At one end, they installed a J-57 jet engine, complete
with an afterburner, and positioned it to aim the devastating jet
exhaust directly at the insulated F-1. With added quilting, thicker
inner skin, and improvements in stressed areas, the engine insulation
received qualification for flight. Only one month hitch occurred. In
the humid, semitropical environment of Cape Kennedy, the internal
quilting acted like a sponge and became thoroughly saturated during a
stiff thundershower. While a Saturn V waited on the pad, engineers
ran frantic tests with water-soaked insulation panels under simulated
flight conditions. These tests introduced the final modifications to
the insulated cocoons-strategically placed vents to let off steam
from the moisture-laden internal quilting.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.53">53</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">From the beginning, the most complete
facilities for full-scale F-1 testing existed at Edwards Air Force
Base, where Air Force work on the engine first began. Their
facilities included several engine test stands and a thrust chamber
stand, also used for injector design studies. The first engine tests
using prototype hardware occurred in the test stand originally built
for the Atlas program and converted to take the larger F-1
[<a name="124"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">124</font></b><font face="Geneva">] dimensions. Researchers scheduled advanced engine
work to use a new stand, capable of holding a pair of engines side by
side. It scat a towering complex, equivalent to an 11-story building,
built with heavily reinforced concrete base and a steel girder
framework anchored deeply in the desert granite to withstand the
punishment of the F-1 engines at full throttle. At the peak of the
development program, Rocketdyne used five separate engine stands at
the Rocket Engine Test Site, an integral unit of the Edwards Air
Force Base complex. The equipment at the Edwards Rocket Engine Test
Site also included a component test stand, a dual-position facility
used for chamber and injector work at full thrust levels. Technicians
began some of the first preliminary design work on this stand, even
though it was not feasible at the time to build supply tanks to
deliver propellants for more than a 20-second run. Despite the short
duration of the experiments, the 20 seconds of roaring engine
operation called for some equipment of remarkable proportions.
Workmen put together the high-pressure propellant tanks with
stainless steel plates 13 centimeters thick and installed fuel and
oxidizer control valves that weighed 6 metric tons each. With such a
complement of metal, the "battleship test" stand was aptly
named.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.54">54</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">To accelerate the test schedules for
production models of the F-1, executives at MSFC decided to test the
engines in Huntsville and ordered appropriate modifications to the
west side of MSFC's static test tower. Thus, while the engine test
stands at Edwards supported ongoing research and development,
Marshall personnel checked out the first batch of production engines
during 1963, sending the F-1's thundering roar through the Tennessee
River valley. The tempo of F-1 engine tests picked up during 1964, as
MSFC personnel ran numerous static tests in Huntsville, and
Rocketdyne supervised continuing work at Edwards Air Force Base. In
October, the new dual-position test stand at Edwards became
operational. The Director of MSFC, Wernher von Braun, flew out to
California for the ceremonies, where he accepted the newly activated
stand on behalf of NASA and then assigned operational responsibility
to Rocketdyne. With all test stands utilized at full capacity, the
Flight Rating Tests of the F-1 propulsion system soon concluded, and
flight qualification was verified by NASA spokesman by the last month
of the year. The concurrent lines of development of stages and
engines now began to converge in Huntsville where a "live" test stage
(the S-IC-T), with a full complement of five F-1 engines, awaited its
first dramatic test firing. The use of MSFC facilities on 16 April
1965 put this phase of testing two months ahead of schedule, and the
6.5-second ignition of the S-IC-T stage generated 33 000 000 newtons
(7 500 000 pounds) of thrust, more collective rocket power than ever
before achieved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">.....contributed to their success. When the
Saturn V took the central role in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
remaining nine Saturn S-IB first stages, along with their 72 H-1
engines, went into storage. When they were earmarked for use in the
Skylab program, many people wondered if such old equipment would
still be reliable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the spring of 1971, nine years after the
delivery of the last production unit, technicians pulled one of the
H-1 engines out of hibernation, to test the "certified lifetime" of
seals, gaskets, and other components. The test was important, not
only for the immediate purpose of Skylab, but to know how other
liquid-fueled rocket engines stored away for future missions were
faring. After an extensive pretest examination, the H-1 was installed
in a test stand at MSFC. Engineers put the engine through its paces:
three separate starts, followed by a full-duration run of 140
seconds. The engine performed as well as at its qualification test
firing, 108 months earlier. MSFC personnel tore the engine down after
firing to see if they could discover any weaknesses, but all the
seals and other critical parts were still in good shape and fully
serviceable. Marshall officials sent the engine back into storage,
satisfied that they could all be called upon to serve any time within
yet another 8-10 years. A year later, during June 1972, Rocketdyne
personnel did similar tests on an F-1 engine that had been delivered
to MSFC in 1965, tested in 1966, and put into storage. The engine was
run through two extended duration firings at Edwards Air Force Base,
then subjected to rigorous inspection and analysis. The engine showed
no abnormalities.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.56">56</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Faith in the engines' lifetime was justified by the
successful launch of the Orbital [<a name="127"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">127</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Workshop aboard a
two-stage Saturn V (S-IC first stage and S-II second stage), followed
by the three successful manned launches of the Saturn IB in support
of the Skylab program in 1973, followed by another Saturn IB in the
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975 (see </font><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch13.htm">chapter 13</a></font><font face="Geneva">).</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">To appreciate the efficiency and dependability
of the H-1, the contributions of engine technology from the Thor,
Jupiter, and Atlas programs must be remembered. These missile
propulsion systems contributed handsomely to the H-1 engine's thrust
chamber, turbopump assembly, gas generator system, control valves,
and other engine assemblies. But the H-1 emerged from its R&amp;D
gestation period as a separate and distinct engine system. Its
components had been completely repackaged for compactness and
improved accessibility-the latter a special problem for the H-1,
created by the first-stage "boat tail." Various components were
refined and strengthened for higher pressures, temperatures, and
propellant flow to achieve the higher thrust levels demanded for the
Saturn missions. Altogether, the designers contrived an assembly that
was smaller and lighter in comparison to its enhanced
performance.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#4.57">57</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Although the F-1 had its roots in early Air
Force studies, it was a "newer" engine than the H-1. Troubles with
the F-1, however, were primarily a function of proportions, not
innovations. Both engines used the same liquid oxygen and RP-1
propellants, but size and performance characteristics made the
</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">F-1 fundamentally different. The H-1
experienced R&amp;D Problems as it was uprated in thrust. Taking
proven H-1 components, such as the injector, and scaling them up to
F-1 requirements turned out to be not only difficult but basically
impossible. The job necessitated a fresh approach. Reworking the
engine and the injector to cope with combustion instability entailed
an R&amp;D effort of notable scope, embracing scientific and
technical specialists from MSFC and other NASA centers, the
contractor, other government agencies, private industry, and
universities. In addition to other F-1 complications, the nature of
the facilities for testing and manufacturing (furnace brazing, for
example) of the F-1 also differentiated it from the smaller
H-1.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The extent to which cryogenic oxidizers and
fuels of the RP-1 type had been used in earlier engines made the H-1
and F-1 conventional propulsion systems. Other Saturn cryogenic
engines used a different, more potent fuel: liquid hydrogen. As the
first large rocket engines to use a cyrogenic fuel, the RL-10 and J-2
were unconventional.</font></p>

studied, and engineers had learned to deal with it. But neither was
yet fully comprehended.</font><p></p>
