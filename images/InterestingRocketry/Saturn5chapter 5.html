fuel appealed to rocket designers because of its high specific
impulse, a basic measure of rocket performance. Compared to an RP-1
(kerosene) fueled engine of similar size, liquid hydrogen fuel could
increase the specific impulse of an engine by 40
percent.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.1">1</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Research into, and application of, gaseous
hydrogen technology waxed and waned over a period of two centuries.
Hydrogen's buoyant qualities when used in balloons made it an early
favorite of daring balloonists in the late 18th century, until the
latent flammability of hydrogen ended too many balloon flight-and
balloonists' careers-in dramatic fashion. Beginning in World War II,
development of large dirigibles brought hydrogen into the limelight
once again. In the 1920s and 1930s, mammoth airships bearing the
flags of the United States, England, France, and Germany challenged
the ocean of air. Because the United States withheld helium for
strategic reasons, the great German zeppelins had to use hydrogen for
buoyancy. With stringent safety precautions, the zeppelins operated
with astonishing reliability and safety on intercontinental routes
for some years, until the cataclysmic destruction of the Hindenburg
in 1937 brought another halt in the development of hydrogen for
travel. Following World War II, the public associated hydrogen with
doomsday weapons, as the Cold War era culminated progressive
development of nuclear arms in the hydrogen bomb, or "H-Bomb," of the
1950s. While use of hydrogen was being perfected for destructive
purposes, developments in rocketry opened the way for a more benign
application in NASA's space program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Serious consideration of liquid hydrogen as a
rocket fuel dated from 1903 when Tsiolkovsky, in his </font><i><font face="Geneva">Treatise on Space Travel</font></i><font face="Geneva">, proposed a rocket [<a name="130"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">130</font></b><font face="Geneva">] engine powered by a
combination of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. However, liquid
hydrogen could not be obtained in quantities for extensive
experimental investigations, and for many years, it remained a
laboratory curiosity with a tantalizing
potential.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.2">2</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Significant research and development of liquid
hydrogen fuel and engines faltered in the United States until the
closing months of World War II, when wartime rocket development led
to consideration of succeeding generations of rocket engines and
fuels.</font></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE LURE OF LIQUID
HYDROGEN</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Late in 1945, the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics
inaugurated a program to investigate the potential of liquid hydrogen
as a rocket propellant. During the following year, the Navy formed
the Committee for Evaluating the Feasibility of Space Rocketry
(CEFSR), within the naval Bureau of Aeronautics, to review the
problems of fuels, engines, vehicle structures, and other
ramifications of advanced rockets. Within the year, CEFSR proposed a
single-stage rocket, with liquid hydrogen as propellant, to boost a
satellite into orbit. It was a very advanced concept, requiring
hardware well ahead of the state of the art. Members of the CEFSR
dubbed their vehicle the High Altitude Test Vehicle, or HATV. The
bureau then negotiated a contract for additional studies with the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of
Technology. Investigators at JPL confirmed the feasibility of the
concept of a satellite booster fueled with liquid hydrogen. Led by
Dr. Théodore von Kármán, several JPL engineers,
intrigued by the esoteric problems of aerodynamics and space flight,
had already organized a small and highly specialized corporation, the
Aerojet Engineering Corporation, which seemed ideally suited to
tangle with some of the hardware problems associated with the
development of liquid hydrogen propellants, engines, and related
systems. Under a separate Navy contract, Aerojet took on the
responsibility of setting up a plant to produce liquid hydrogen in
volume, and developing test stands to try out experimental liquid
hydrogen rocket engines.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.3">3</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The work at Aerojet included the design,
construction, and operation of high-performance injectors and thrust
chambers that operated in the range from 1780 newtons (400 pounds) of
thrust to 13 350 newtons (3000 pounds) of thrust. The company also
successfully tested a liquid hydrogen engine pump, a single-stage
centrifugal model that performed with shaft speeds up to 35 000
revolutions per minute. In 1947, the Aerojet General Corporation
announced a working 13 350-newton (3000-pound) thrust liquid hydrogen
engine. The direction of the work, and the attendant requirements for
cryogenic supplies and storage, led to the design, construction, and
operation of a plant to produce liquid hydrogen by 1949.
Investigation of cryogenic engines was also under way
[<a name="131"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">131</font></b><font face="Geneva">] at Ohio State University, under the direction of Dr.
Herrick L. Johnston, whose research team successfully fired a
liquid-hydrogen engine of significant size in 1945. Dr. Johnston
served as a consultant in the design of the California plant and
contributed several technical devices used in the operational layout.
The insulation procedures for this pioneering facility were also
adapted from Johnston's research at Ohio State.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.4">4</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The Aerojet operation afforded invaluable
experience in the production and handling of liquid hydrogen, which
seemed to he less ticklish than hydrogen gas. "On the whole," some
early personnel recalled, "liquid hydrogen is less hazardous than
high-pressure gaseous oxygen, and it may, in fact, be regarded as a
highly volatile gasoline." Much of the concern with liquid hydrogen
centered on the "boil-off" rate and the problems of transfer between
production lines, storage, and test sites. Designers planned the
production facility to achieve a capacity of 6 kilograms of liquid
hydrogen per hour, probably the largest plant of its kind in
existence. Actual production from September 1948 to June 1949 totaled
336 kilograms of liquid hydrogen, including 2406 kilograms in the
last four months of the production period.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.5">5</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Small by later standards, when compared to the
hundreds of thousands of kilograms used in Saturn missions, this
output represented a notable pioneering effort in the development of
liquid hydrogen technology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The phaseout of Aerojet's production plant and
early engine work coincided with the demise of the Navy's hopes for
the HATV program under the CEFSR. With cost estimates fluctuating
between $8 million and $82 million, the Navy hierarchy blanched at
the idea of HATV, especially because there seemed to be no immediate
military application for it. Undaunted, the CEFSR group tried several
routes between 1946 and 1948, including the Army and Air Force; both
finally said no. Before the final curtain for the HATV project, CEFSR
let a contract to North American Aviation in 1946 to do preliminary
studies for a liquid hydrogen rocket engine designed for a HATV
rocket 34 meters high and 5 meters in diameter. With a weight of
about 46 053 kilograms, including 40 406 kilograms of propellants,
the vehicle design specifications called for a propulsion system
delivering up to 1 334 400 newtons (300 000 pounds) of thrust at
liftoff. The HATV project never materialized as an operational
system, although it served a useful function in the accumulation of
basic technology that contributed to the successful Apollo-Saturn
program. As one acute observer summed it up, "The Navy's HATV had
laid the groundwork for the hydrogen engine, the first new advance in
rocketry since the V-2."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.6">6</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">ENTER THE CENTAUR</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The distinction of being the first liquid
hydrogen rocket system to reach development went to the Centaur,
developed and managed by the [<a name="132"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">132</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Astronautics
Division of General Dynamics Corporation. An important aspect of the
Centaur story can be traced to the research supported by the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), at its Lewis Laboratory in
Cleveland, Ohio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Researchers at the Lewis facility concentrated
on military piston engines during World War II, until NACA abruptly
changed the direction of the research efforts. John L. Sloop, one of
the Lewis staff members during the "big switch" in the autumn of
1945, recounted the sudden reordering of priorities. "While the
laboratory was thus engaged (in military piston engines), others were
rapidly progressing in jet engine R&amp;D," he recalled. "The moment
of truth came to NACA in 1945 and overnight the NACA management
switched the laboratory emphasis from piston engines to jet engines,
and the staff was reorganized from stem to stern in the process." The
changeover to jet engine, or turbine, research included one or two
other esoteric areas of investigation, assigned without warning to
many of the lower level supervisors and researchers who had not been
informed of the impending changes. Sloop himself went home on the eve
of the change, "deeply engaged in writing a report on spark plug
fouling." When he reported back to work in the morning, still
engrossed in dirty spark plugs, Sloop found his desk gone, himself
relocated to a different building, and learned that he was forthwith
involved in the problem of cooling rocket engines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The NACA executives kept the rocket engine
business cloaked in obscurity. The political climate at the time was
such that "NACA leaders in Washington did not want to proclaim
publicly that they were sanctioning work on guided missiles in an
aeronautical laboratory, so the group was officially called the High
Pressure Combustion Section." This subterfuge remained in force for
four years, until Abe Silverstein took over technical management of
the Lewis Laboratory in 1949. He acknowledged the significance of the
work on rocketry, upgraded the then small group in rank and priority,
and officially named it the Rocket Research
Branch.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.7">7</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As they surveyed the past work accomplished in
rocket research, the former piston-engine and spark-plug experts
realized the vast amount of catching up they had ahead of them. When
documents became available, the researchers read reports from wartime
German work "with great interest," and the research papers of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory also became basic texts. After comparing their
inexperience with the more advanced and sophisticated research
elsewhere, the rocket group at Lewis made a historic decision to dig
into some of the lesser known areas of liquid propellants. By this
route, they plowed ahead into the comparatively uncharted seas of
high-energy liquid engines-their propellants, combustion
characteristics, and cooling problems. After computing theoretical
performances of a number of high-energy fuels, the group's first
choices narrowed down to hydrazine, diborane, and ammonia, with
oxidizers like chlorine trifluoride, hydrogen peroxide, and liquid
[<a name="133"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">133</font></b><font face="Geneva">] oxygen. In the late 1940s, the group was most
attracted to the combination of liquid fluorine oxidizer and diborane
as fuel. On the first hot-firing test, the engine melted. Interest in
diborane fuels rapidly waned after this unsettling experience, but
interest in a fluoride oxidizer continued. After several other
candidate fuels were tried and set aside, fluoride and liquid
hydrogen came under intensive development in the latter half of the
1950s. The Lewis group kept a file on hydrogen work, so they were
aware of the Navy-JPL proposals, the Aerojet liquefaction plant and
engines, and the work being done at Ohio State under Herrick
Johnston. Consistent with the Lewis group's own activities in
high-energy propellants, experimental facilities for liquid hydrogen,
among others, were proposed in 1952, but the facility for extensive
work in this field was not put into operation until 1956.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The group's work succeeded in technical
refinements, such as simulating altitude performance techniques, and
in garnering growing support from Lewis Laboratory's director, Abe
Silverstein. He developed increasing enthusiasm for liquid hydrogen
for applications in high-altitude aircraft, as well as high-energy
rockets. Buttressed by Silverstein's endorsement, the rocket research
team rapidly progressed in the design of lightweight, regeneratively
cooled hydrogen engines of up to 90 000 newtons (20 000 pounds) of
thrust. Much of this rapport and enthusiasm was generated during
free-wheeling, after-hours bull sessions, hosted by Silverstein,
which were honorifically dubbed as "design conferences." The
participants unwound and exchanged ideas over beer and pretzels. From
one of these diffuse sessions came an important Lewis design known as
the "showerhead injector" for liquid rocket
engines.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.8">8</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">By the late 1950s, the rocket group at Lewis
worked with both hydrogen-fluorine and hydrogen-oxygen propellants,
fired in a regeneratively cooled engine. Liquid fluorine presented
special problems in operations, however, and Silverstein apparently
had growing doubts about it. "Later, when he witnessed a
hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine operation, the sweetness of the
hydrogen-oxygen combination came through to him, and to us, loud and
clear," Sloop said. By this time, rocket research at the Lewis
Laboratory had increased considerably. Some assignments included
preparatory work on propulsion systems for satellites and missions to
the moon. Looking back, Sloop and his associates took quiet pride in
their contributions to liquid hydrogen engine technology. "We believe
that the Lewis work on hydrogen in rocket engines, although not
first, was both timely and significant," said Sloop. "We showed that
lightweight, regeneratively cooled thrust chambers of 22 250 and 90
000 newtons (5000 and 20 000 pounds) of thrust could operate at very
high efficiencies."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Of special significance was the relationship
of the Lewis activity to the Centaur program-under the auspices of
the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)-and particularly to the
hydrogen engines [<a name="134"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">134</font></b><font face="Geneva">] produced by Pratt
&amp; Whitney. One of the ARPA personnel, Richard Canright, also
served as a member of NACA's Special Subcommittee for Rocket Engines,
and thereby became very familiar with the work at Lewis. A number of
key personnel from United Aircraft and Pratt &amp; Whitney, who also
worked on hydrogen engines, paid numerous visits to Lewis to see what
was going on and to talk with the rocket group there. Eventually, the
Pratt &amp; Whitney observers graciously conceded their debt to
Lewis's various injector designs, as well as to crucial experimental
statistics employed in the development of the XLR-15 engine (an early
designation for the RL-10 engine used in the Centaur and, later, in
the Saturn upper stages).</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Last but not least, the Lewis experience had a
definite impact on the direction of the Saturn program very early in
the game. After the organization of NASA, Silverstein went to
Washington to serve as Director of Space Flight Development. In
anticipation of the Army's transfer of Saturn to NASA, NASA's
Associate Administrator tapped Silverstein to chair a special
interagency committee to consider the scope of Saturn's development,
and to submit recommendations on goals and implementation,
particularly the configuration of the upper stages. "With a
persuasive chairman occupying a key position and sold on
hydrogen-oxygen, it is not surprising that the group recommended that
the upper stages of Saturn be hydrogen-oxygen," observed Sloop,
somewhat sardonically. Perhaps the most notable contribution of the
Lewis rocket group, he concluded, lay in its influence on the
decision that shaped the design of the Saturn's upper
stages.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.9">9</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">This slice of slightly overripe prose, a
product of Centaur's public relations office,</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.10">10</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> manages to summarize some characteristic trends in
America's space program. The Centaur effort, particularly the
propulsion system, illustrates both the triumphs and the tribulations
of liquid hydrogen technology. The effort also highlights some of the
differentiations found in rocket vehicles such as the Centaur, S-IV,
and S-IVB on the basis of a type of propellant system common to all
three.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With Atlas operational and successful, General
Dynamics/ Astronautics (GD/A) began to consider its uses as a launch
vehicle for space missions. [<a name="135"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">135</font></b><font face="Geneva">] By adding on a
second stage, the company's planners hoped to achieve a design
capable of heavier payloads than currently employed as missile
warheads. Serious studies began in 1956, contemplating payloads like
high-altitude satellites for early missile warning, global
reconnaissance, weather scanning, and communications. Such payloads
required a very-high-energy stage to boost them into orbit. The GD/A
investigating team chose liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen as
propellants.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.11">11</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The team had looked into a number of high-energy
propellant combinations, including fluorine as an oxidizer, but
fluorine did not promise a significant gain in specific impulse and
performance. Besides, the choice of liquid oxygen would continue the
use of well grounded operational technology, and save considerable
time and development efforts. When it came to the choice of fuel, the
team again considered several options, but chose to rely on liquid
hydrogen, because its specific impulse came closest to the upper
limits that could be attained with chemical propellants. Selection of
liquid hydrogen was a knowledgeable gamble: Pratt &amp; Whitney was
not a total stranger to this new area of cryogenic technology. In the
mid-1950s, the Air Force had been working on experimental jet engines
using LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> fuel, and Pratt &amp; Whitney had been deeply involved
in this research. Even though liquid hydrogen entailed problems as a
jet engine fuel, many company engineers viewed hydrogen as the most
promising fuel for applications in future rocket technology, either
for chemical or nuclear propulsion. "Also," the company noted, "this
vehicle would offer a favorable starting point for the development of
this technology, because of its limited size and because none of the
missions yet required very long storage periods in space, as would be
the case with future hydrogen-powered vehicles."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.12">12</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In its formal proposal, GD/A outlined a
program with potential for various high-altitude satellites for
strategic use, adding the possibilities of deep-space probes and even
manned orbital configurations. As a launch vehicle, the GD/A
specifications recommended a modified Atlas ICBM first stage with
conventional liquid oxygen and RP-1 propellants, and a four-engine
second stage (still on the drawing boards) using oxygen-hydrogen as
oxidizer and propellant. It was the proposed second stage that
appealed to the USAF Air Research and Development Command, who
selected it from several unsolicited proposals involving satellites
for communications. On 14 November 1958, GD/A received a contract to
manufacture a total of six hydrogen-oxygen upper stages for ARPA,
marking the formal origins of the Centaur program. The Air Force
tagged the Atlas-Centaur as its launch system for Advent, a
synchronous-orbit equatorial communications satellite.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">While GD/A tooled up for the fabrication of
the vehicle's tanks and structure in San Diego, Pratt &amp; Whitney

development and testing of the Pratt &amp; Whitney engine, the USAF
planned a production facility for liquid hydrogen near Pratt &amp;
Whitney's West Palm Beach location. As the program developed, and the
Centaur's engines were conscripted for use in NASA's space program,
engine testing also occurred at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).
Lewis Research Center, Edwards Air Force Base, and two other Pratt

<p><font face="Geneva">Even before the Silverstein recommendations in
December 1959, the channels that brought high-energy hydrogen-oxygen
engines into the Saturn program had begun to converge. At Huntsville,
Alabama in the spring of 1959, preliminary upper-stage vehicle
studies for the Saturn program included the Centaur as a third stage.
The final recommendations of the Silverstein committee, coupled with
the prior interest in the high-energy Centaur, finally locked liquid
hydrogen into the Saturn's development. Oswald Lange, a key figure in
the early Saturn program at MSFC, considered the Centaur's engines "a
major technological breakthrough." Before the Army Ballistic Missiles
Agency phased out, the ABMA Saturn project designated the Pratt &amp;
Whitney engines as the propulsion system for the Saturn's third
stage. "The early choice of Centaur," said Lange, "had far-reaching
effects on the Saturn development, program."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.14">14</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Following the organization of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, Centaur was assigned to the civilian space
program under the aegis of NASA's MSFC. Centaur was ticketed as one
[<a name="137"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">137</font></b><font face="Geneva">] of the upper stages for Surveyor and Mariner lunar
and planetary missions, and MSFC began to plan Centaur's role in the
development of the Saturn vehicles. MSFC's role in Centaur management
was somewhat controversial. Some people at NASA Headquarters argued
that the Air Force should manage the Centaur engine because of its
original military mission as a communications-satellite booster. At
Huntsville, the Centaur engine effort might have been submerged by
the Saturn program.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.15">15</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The Saturn program's association with the
development of liquid hydrogen-oxygen engines officially commenced on
10 August 1960, when MSFC signed a contract with Pratt &amp; Whitney
for the development and production of at, engine, known as the
LR-119, to be used in the S-IV and S-V stages of the C-1 vehicle
envisioned in the Silverstein report. Designed to give 66 700 newtons
(17 500 pounds) of thrust, the LR-119 was an uprated version of an
early Centaur engine concept, the LR-115. Problems with the
development of this new version led to the reconsideration of the
original Centaur propulsion system, and in March 1961, the management
of MSFC recommended the design of a liquid-hydrogen S-IV stage using
the original LR-115 hardware. To compensate for the loss of thrust,
MSFC decided to cluster six engines instead of four. On 29 March
1961, NASA Headquarters concurred, and the new six-engine cluster
became the official configuration. In the course of development,
Pratt &amp; Whitney assigned various designations to the basic liquid
hydrogen-oxygen engine. The final design, RL-10-A-1, replaced both
the LR-115 and 119, and the RL-10 configuration became standard for
both the Centaur and S-IV vehicles by 1961. An early version of the
RL-10 design went through its first successful firing in August 1959,
and by the winter of 1961, technicians finished the last of the
RL-10-A-1 preflight rating tests. The engine's 66 700 newtons (15 000
pounds) of thrust performed 30 percent better than similar designs
using hydrocarbon fuels. The A-1 designation identified a test
article; on 9 June 1962, Pratt &amp; Whitney finished the preliminary
flight rating tests on the RL-10-A-3, intended for installation in
operational flight versions of the second stage of the C-1 launch
vehicle.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.16">16</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The nation's first operational liquid hydrogen-oxygen

The Saturn program's RL-10 engines were mounted on the S-IV booster
manufactured by Douglas as the second stage for the Saturn I. In
physical terms, the RL-10 was about as tall as an average man. Its
major components included the thrust chamber, fuel and oxidizer
[<a name="138"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">138</font></b><font face="Geneva">] turbopump assembly, liquid oxygen flow control valve,
spark ignition subsystem, thrust control assembly, and miscellaneous
control valves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The contours of the nozzle configuration owed
much to the influence of applied mathematics. Pratt &amp; Whitney
wanted a nozzle designed for optimum size and weight in relation to
performance, but liquid hydrogen technology was so new that few
ground rules were available. Applied math bypassed a lot of costly
hardware experimentation, and Pratt &amp; Whitney claimed that the
procedures established during the effort became widely used within
the rocket propulsion industry.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.18">18</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The injector, part of the thrust chamber
assembly, featured a porous injector face, which was an important
innovation. The RL-10 injector strongly resembled a large dish with a
shallow, concave surface. Fabricated from material that looked like a
heavy screen, the injector's propellant orifices poked through the
mesh in concentric rings. The porous injector face did, in fact,
consist of layers of stainless steel mesh, produced by a carefully
controlled sintering procedure that caused the layers of mesh to
become a coherent structure without melting. A controlled flow of
gaseous hydrogen filtered through, cooling the injector face and
reducing thermal stresses. The material, called Rigi-Mesh by its
supplier (the Pall Corporation), apparently originated as a filter
used in nuclear research. The product had been extensively used in
hydraulic and pneumatic filters in aircraft and jet engines, where
extreme vibration environments, high temperatures, and other
operational requirements discouraged the use of nonmetallic filters.
How Rigi-Mesh was first suggested for use in rocket thrust chambers
is unclear. In any case, the Pratt &amp; Whitney injector approach,
using the porous mesh face, was a distinct improvement over
conventional, flat-face injectors that Lewis Research Center had
used.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.19">19</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven in a
"boot strap" arrangement from a turbine assembly rated at 479 to 513
kilowatts. The propellant pumps consisted of a two-stage centrifugal
fuel pump and a single-stage centrifugal oxidizer pump. General
Dynamics/ Astronautics described the engine's turbopump as the key to
operating the RL-10 production version, in which the "boot strap"
sequence used gaseous hydrogen. At the start, liquid hydrogen
trickled through the turbopump and down through the thrust chamber
tubes of the regeneratively cooled engine. Even before the ignition
sequence and main stage operation, the flowing liquid hydrogen became
gaseous, and could be forced back through the turbopump with enough
pressure to start it. This pressure set the hydrogen fuel pump in
motion, and a gear train from the hydrogen turbine's main shaft began
to drive the liquid oxygen pump-the "boot strap" sequence. After the
start of combustion, the heat produced enough gas in the chamber
walls to drive the high-speed turbine and also to maintain the
combustion level.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.20">20</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="140"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">140</font></b><font face="Geneva">] This design offered
two main advantages. First, the engine did not require a third
propellant or a bipropellant to service a gas generator system (at a
weight penalty) for the turbopump. Second, the designers obtained an
efficient performance advantage because the hydrogen gases, after
driving the turbine, were exhausted into the combustion chamber. All
propellants, then, contributed directly to maximum thrust and highest
specific impulse. The operation of the turbomachinery incorporated
another interesting design feature. The RL-10 was the first
production engine to use liquid hydrogen in place of conventional
lubrication systems.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.21">21</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During the test program, NASA and contractor
personnel pushed the design to extremes to verify the engine's
capability. Designed for a total firing time of 470 seconds, test
engineers piled more than 3.5 times that duration onto one engine,
running it for a total of 1680 seconds. Some of the test engines
successfully operated through 5 to 70 separate firings with no
maintenance or replacement of parts, equivalent in some instances to
10 round trips to the moon. "This philosophy of `limits' testing has
proven successful in developing an engine with a high reliability and
a high degree of confidence," explained key personnel in MSFC's
engine program office. They characterized the pioneering RL-10 as a
system of notable sophistication and versatility.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.22">22</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">ORIGINS OF THE J-2
ENGINE</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Because of the known high-energy qualities of
hydrogen as a fuel, modern rocket propulsion engineers manifested a
continuing interest in liquid hydrogen as an attractive rocket
propellant, able to lift payloads at a very favorable fuel-to-payload
ratio. The potential of the liquid hydrogen RL-10 engine was
encouraging; nevertheless, designers were thinking ahead of the
RL-10's 67 000 newtons (15 000 pounds) of thrust to even heftier
propulsion systems. In the fall of 1959, various NASA studies and
contracts already included examination of 665 000-newton (150
000-pound) thrust engines, used singly or in clusters, which burned
LOX and LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">. When very large space vehicles came into
consideration, NASA began to revise its thinking toward even larger
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">-fueled engines for high-energy upper stages-engines
rated at 890 000 newtons (200 000 pounds) of thrust. Such a
remarkable goal achieved official sanction during the deliberations
of the Saturn Vehicle Team, better known as the Silverstein
committee, which finished its work and reported its recommendations
to NASA on 15 December 1959.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.23">23</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Following the Silverstein committee's
recommendations, a source evaluation board was formed to nominate a
contractor. The board included a pair of special teams-a technical
evaluation team and a business evaluation team-to examine proposals
on two separate levels. [<a name="141"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">141</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Members, who met in
Washington for six weeks, were chosen from Marshall, Lewis, and NASA
Headquarters. The full board, chaired by MSFC's Hermann Weidner (a
Peenemuende veteran and a senior MSFC propulsion engineer), submitted
its final recommendation to NASA Administrator Glennan for approval.
Glennan made the final announcement. In competition with four other
companies, Rocketdyne Division of North American Aviation won NASA's
approval on 1 June 1960 to develop a high-energy rocket engine,
fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen, to be known as the J-2.
Specifications for the liquid-hydrogen engine originated at MSFC, and
the contractor then went to work on the initial design concepts and
hardware. At every step of the way, the contractor and the customer
(MSFC) exchanged information and ideas derived from earlier programs,
modifying them for the requirements of the LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engine technology,
and devising new techniques to implement the design goals of the new
rocket powerplant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The final contract, negotiated by Rocketdyne
in September 1960, included an especially notable feature. For the
first time, a high-energy, high-thrust rocket engine contract
specified a design to "insure maximum safety for manned flight."
Beginning with the first specifications through the subsequent stages
of design, development, and final qualification, planning for manned
missions became a mainline theme for Rocketdyne engineers. Other
engines in NASA's space program stemmed from propulsion systems
engineered for unmanned satellites or ballistic missiles such as the
Vanguard, Redstone, Atlas, and Thor. From the start, exceedingly
stiff reliability specifications for the J-2 reflected the engine's
role in a manned mission. Reliability reviews began at the drawing
board stage, and follow-up tests to verify the preceding test and
design specifications continued in relentless succession. The
technical management organization established to monitor the J-2
development consisted of three major groups. First, the design review
board scrutinized each part of the J-2, analyzed it from a technical
viewpoint, and investigated all of its design factors. Next, a
reliability task force developed statistical methods tailored
specifically to proposed test programs for the engine. Finally, all
elements dovetailed in the Performance Evaluation and Review
Technique (PERT), a reporting system used by the overall program
management team.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.24">24</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Rocketdyne launched the development of the J-2
with an analytical computer model that simulated engine operations
and aided in establishing design configurations. One outgrowth of the
model, a full-sized mockup with which to judge position of all
components, remained an important tool throughout the J-2
program.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.25">25</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="142"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">142</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Rocketdyne's
physical plant and long experience as a rocket engine manufacturer
allowed the company to respond quickly. The main complex at Canoga
Park, in the northwest sector of Los Angeles, combined engineering
offices with elaborate laboratories for preliminary R&amp;D.
Development and production of the F-1 and the H-1 (and its immediate
predecessor, the S-3D), coupled with extensive experimental work on
advanced propulsion systems, equipped the company with excellent
facilities and experienced R&amp;D teams. Rocketdyne carried out J-2
firing tests and major-component tests at its Santa Susanna Field
Laboratory, a rambling network of test stands and test cells set up
in canyons and arroyos of the Santa Susanna Mountains, directly above
the manufacturing area at Canoga Park. In days gone by, the canyon
walls and gulches echoed with the drumbeat hooves of galloping horses
and the sharp crackle of gunfire as Hollywood production crews
cranked out yet another Western epic. Now the arroyo walls enveloped
test beds for rocket engines, the steep slopes shielding the rest of
the test areas and their crews in case something went wrong and an
engine blew up. A visit to the surrealistic environs of Santa Susanna
made a lasting impression. It was a tortured, sun-baked tumble of
rocks and scraggly underbrush, with the separate test areas connected
by long runs of piping for water and miscellaneous esoteric liquids
required in rocket development. The pipes erratically twisted their
way over the boulder-strewn landscape and up to the test
fixtures-austere monoliths of concrete and stark steel girders
jutting into the hot California sky. It seemed a fitting environment
for the exotic world of rocket engine testing.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.26">26</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Within two months of winning its contract, an
R&amp;D team put together the J-2's first experimental component, a
full-scale injector. Using a temporary test facility at Santa
Susanna, Rocketdyne technicians conducted the first hot-firing tests
on 11 November 1960, to check out the workability of its design. In
simultaneous programs, the company began developing means to test
engines as well as engine components, modifying test stands as
required. A large vacuum chamber to test engine subsystems under
simulated space conditions was completed. By the end of 1960, the
manufacturing planners, with an eye on problems encountered during
the early design and phase, began to try to resolve some of the
sticky manufacturing problems looming on the horizon. The schedule
was obviously getting tighter as the research and development teams
began the fabrication and assembly of the first experimental
components and emplaced them in the test cells. Inaugurating
Rocketdyne's first test facility built exclusively for the J-2
program, workers activated a component test cell in November 1961,
and engineers began trial runs of the J-2 liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen turbopumps. Early in 1962, only 18
[<a name="143"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">143</font></b><font face="Geneva">] months after contract award, Rocketdyne conducted the
first engine system test for ignition, lasting 2.57 seconds. The test
unit used an uncooled thrust chamber with the turbopumps driven by
externally supplied gaseous hydrogen, instead of using the engine's
internal gas generator.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Drawing further on its considerable fund of
experience in developing rocket engines for Army and Air Force
programs, Rocketdyne personnel fabricated additional test components
of the new J-2 in remarkably short order, and began to piece together
the first experimental engine in the closing months of 1961.
Technicians made final checks on the engine in the company's Canoga
Park complex during January 1962 and stowed it on a truck, to be
driven up the winding mountain to the Santa Susanna Field Laboratory.
Short-run tests began the same month and continued through the
summer. Technicians were achieving full-thrust testing of 50 to 94
seconds duration by early autumn, and on 4 October 1962, Rocketdyne
successfully ran the engine through a long- duration test of 250
seconds.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.27">27</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During the early developmental period in J-2
testing, the engine's place in Saturn rocket configurations also
stabilized. In July 1962, NASA and Rocketdyne concluded contracts for
continued development and formalized the production agreements for
the J-2 through 1965. About the same time, NASA announced plans for a
new two-stage vehicle, the Saturn C-1B (later the IB) for operations
leading to Earth-orbital missions with a full-sized Apollo
spacecraft.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.28">28</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The J-2 engine was intended to power the S-IVB stage
of two Saturn vehicles-the second stage of the Saturn IB and the
third stage of the Saturn V. In addition, a cluster of five J-2
engines was also planned for the S-II second stage of the three-stage
Saturn V vehicle, making the J-2 the most used cryogenic propulsion
system in the Saturn program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">NASA and Rocketdyne signed a contract for 55
engines and development of appropriate support technology on 1 July
1962. Later in the month, Rocketdyne announced its plans for the
construction of two new manufacturing buildings for the Saturn
engines, including the J-2. The buildings were completed in record
time; the company moved in just a year later. In November 1963,
Rocketdyne began delivery of five engine simulators. Up to the point
of actual firing, the simulators played an important role in the
process of electrical and mechanical design of the ground support
equipment furnished by Rocketdyne, and permitted technicians to work
out the interfacing details involved in mounting the engine to the
appropriate stage-the S-II stage manufactured by North American, or
the S-IVB stage manufactured by Douglas. Ground support equipment,
operating consoles, and special handling gear for the
[<a name="144"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">144</font></b><font face="Geneva">] engines and propellants were used in Rocketdyne's own
manufacturing and test operations in California, at other test sites
(Marshall and Mississippi Test Facility), and in launch operations at
Cape Kennedy.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.29">29</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE J-2: LEGACIES AND
INNOVATIONS</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Confident with the test results during 1962,
Rocketdyne began to release the first production drawings to the
manufacturing shops early in 1963. The J-2 engine emerged from the
drafting boards as a self-contained propulsion system-a significant
concept because the J-2 had to start in flight, shut itself down,
then (in some versions) restart in orbit. Explaining the engine at a
meeting of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,
Paul Fuller (Rocketdyne's project manager for the J-2 in 1965)
stressed the effort given to the self-contained design philosophy.
"The J-2 engine is not just a rocket engine supplying thrust for the
vehicle, but is a fully integrated propulsion system" Fuller
emphasized. "The engine provides all functions important to the
vehicle's operation and mission capability." For this reason, engine
and stage operation systems were closely integrated. To maintain tank
pressure and still control the weight of the vehicles, the S-IV and
S-IVB pressurized their fuel tanks by tapping hydrogen gas from the
fuel manifold on the thrust chamber. To keep up pressure in the LOX
tank, designers included a heat exchanger on the oxygen pump exhaust
duct. In the S-II second stage, hot oxygen from the exchanger served
as the pressurant, while in the S-IVB, stored helium ran through the
exchanger and back into the LOX tank. These systems eliminated the
need for other pressurants along with their extra weight and
complexity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The S-IVB, with a programmed restart in Earth
orbit, included a "self-servicing" concept for the reignition
sequence. The helium tanks included enough gas for the duration of
the mission, but to get enough hydrogen gas to accelerate
turbomachinery for the restart cycle, the engine system automatically
diverted 1 kilogram of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> from the fuel system
for storage in the depleted hydrogen start tank. To ensure proper
functioning of the entire system during a mission, the engine's
designers included integral instrumentation on the J-2 to monitor
engine functIons on 72 different channels.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.30">30</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">For the integrated engine system philosophy,
designers of the J-2 borrowed from many earlier liquid propellant
engines, including the liquid hydrogen technology of the RL-10
program, and added a few innovations along the way. In the process,
technicians and manufacturing engineers learned to cope with the
problems generated by the J-2 as a newer and much larger generation
of liquid-hydrogen engine systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Like the RL-10, the J-2 injector had to
promote stable, controlled burning. But the 890 000-newton (200
000-pound) thrust J-2 burned [<a name="145"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">145</font></b><font face="Geneva">] much greater
quantities of cryogenic propellants than the 67 000-newton (15
000-pound) thrust RL-10. When Rocketdyne started work on the injector
in 1960, the company tried a design familiar to its engineers, and
built flat-faced copper injectors similar to LOX-RP-1 designs. The
heat fluxes of LOX-LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> designs turned out
to be much different at the injector face, and the injectors started
burning out. Bob Pease, an MSFC propulsion engineer who monitored
some of the early tests, recalled that green flames shot out of one
injector as the flame front started burning its way through the
copper.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As one Marshall engineer observed, it was the
general nature of a contractor to be reluctant to take on a
competitor's innovation. Rocketdyne's injectors kept burning out, but
the company seemed adamant against incorporating the porous injector
face style of Pratt &amp; Whitney's RL-10. Rocketdyne had been
experimenting with this type of injector at NASA's insistence, and
Marshall began to feel that their J-2 contractor needed a shove in
this direction, instead of the persistent nudges delivered by MSFC up
to this point. Lewis Research Center had all the information and
hardware samples for the porous injector face. Jerry Thomson and
other Marshall engineers dragooned Rocketdyne personnel into a
special trip to Lewis in 1962 to look at the samples, and pressured
Rocketdyne to use Rigi-Mesh in the injector face. With Rigi-Mesh
adapted to the J-2, the problems of injector face burning
disappeared.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.31">31</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Still, Rocketdyne's larger engine and its
operational characteristics presented difficulties in manufacturing.
The successful design led to the next set of problems: how to "mass
produce" a rocket engine injector with more than 600 uniform
injection posts. After some trial and error, manufacturing engineers
finally evolved a method of producing an injector with 614 uniform
posts from a single piece of metal, using a special technique of
electrical discharge machining. Fuel from the upper fuel manifold
flowed into the combustion area through fuel orifices designed to be
concentric with the oxidizer orifices. Design of the injector and
angles of the orifices was calculated for highest combustion
efficiency. As the hydrogen passed through the injector to the
annular orifices, 5 percent of the flow seeped through the porous
injector face, acting as a coolant to reduce thermal stresses created
by the roaring combustion chamber.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.32">32</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The J-2's thrust chamber consisted of several
hundred steel tubes, designed and shaped according to data derived by
computer. The computer helped solve the frustrating interplay of "the
general energy equation, momentum equation, continuity equation,
equation of state, and heat balance equation across tube walls." The
readout of the computer proved to be very accurate, the final design
of a tapered, formed tube bearing very close conformance with the
original analytical model. Designers made optimum use of the
marvelous facility of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> for heat transfer in
designing the thrust chamber. [<a name="146"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">146</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Fuel entered the
chamber through a manifold at the chamber's midpoint, making a
one-half pass down through 180 tubes on the outside, then up the
inside of the chamber's throat in a complete pass through 360 tubes
to the fuel injector. The liquid hydrogen entered the tubes at
-253°C (-423°F) and warmed up in passage to "only"
-162°C (-260°F), at which point it became gaseous. The
design of the tubes permitted extremely wide variations in
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
velocities, ranging from 18 meters per second at the bottom of the
pass at the chamber's edge to 300 meters per second at the throat,
and 240 meters per second at the injector entry ports. At different
points within the tubes, cross sections varied correspondingly to
accommodate changes in density and flow rates.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.33">33</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> With so many variables in the design, it is no wonder
that the computer played such a pivotal role in engine
development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Turbopump design borrowed liberally from North
American's experience in manufacturing jet aircraft engines and the
early rocket engines for the Air Force. As in jet engines, the
turbopump turbine blades featured a "fir tree" attachment technique.
The bases of the blades were tapered and notched, giving them the
silhouette of an inverted fir tree. Centrifugal forces in the
turbopumps were terrifically high, and the notched blades kept them
securely in place. From the Atlas program, Rocketdyne borrowed
turbopump inducer designs and the inducer tunnel assembly, but many,
many more components had to be conceived and fabricated to the
characteristics of the new LOX-LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> technology.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In designing the J-2 turbopumps to deliver
propellants to the injector and the combustion chamber, the system
was split into two different components, the LOX pump and
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
pump mounted separately on either side of the combustion chamber.
This approach avoided compromises in the efficiency of either pump
and eliminated a complicated set of gears to run both pumps from a
single shaft. On the LOX side, the J-2 used a radial pump, common to
most rocket engines, which operated in the 6000 revolutions per
minute range. The LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> pump, by contrast,
used a pump uncommon in large thrust engines, at the time-a
seven-stage axial flow design with an operating capability of over 25
000 revolutions per minute. With proper calibration, the pumps
delivered propellants to the thrust chamber at a rate of 2.3
kilograms of liquid oxygen to 0.4 kilogram of
hydrogen.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.34">34</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Power for the turbopumps came from a
two-stage, velocity-compound turbine fired by a gas generator. The
original design for the J-2 engine envisioned a "tank-head" start, in
which pressure from the fuel tanks started the gas generator. Once in
operation, the feed pressures and power increased as the turbopump
attained its operational limits, drawing propellants from the tanks.
The "tank-head" start was attractively simple but turned out to be
too slow to be used in flight operations for the Saturn. So the
turbine power system acquired augmentation for the spinup of the gas
generator, using a spherical tank to store compressed
[<a name="147"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">147</font></b><font face="Geneva">] hydrogen gas with a storage capacity of 0.1 cubic
meter. Gas from the hydrogen sphere started the gas generator and
achieved rapid acceleration and operation from the start. This
"gas-spin" start could be initiated at will during the flight,
important for reignition of the S-IVB stage in Earth parking orbit.
The only requirement involved a brief cycle during the engine run, in
which hydrogen gas was tapped to recharge the hydrogen
sphere.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.35">35</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The design of the hydrogen storage tank constituted a
unique feature of the J-2 engine: it incorporated a "tank within a
tank," combining hydrogen storage with a helium storage tank. The
helium, required for the pneumatic control system, tended to vent off
unless kept under pressure at a low temperature. In a neat solution
to the problem, Rocketdyne designed the helium storage tank as an
integral unit inside the hydrogen start tank, and thereby saved space
as well as weight. Both tanks were filled on the ground prior to
launch-the outside tank with hydrogen, the inner tank with
helium.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.36">36</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The 1 1/2-pass fuel circuit permitted another
design variation, in the disposal of the exhaust gas from the
turbopumps. The gas delivered from the gas generator to the
propellant turbopumps passed in sequence through the hydrogen axial
flow turbines, then through a duct into the radial turbine of the LOX
pump. The series arrangement yielded a very high efficiency and
permitted easy control of the thrust and mixture ratios. Having
already performed double duty in both the fuel and oxidizer
turbopumps, the turbine gas exhausted into the thrust chamber to be
used as fuel. In this way, the engine handled the turbine exhaust
very conveniently and enhanced the engine's specific impulse at the
same time.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.37">37</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The high speeds at which the J-2's moving
parts functioned required some special lubricants, which were
acquired from the propellants themselves. Ball bearings in the
turbopumps present special problems in lubrication- particularly the
super-cold LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> pumps. Normal lubricating oils proved troublesome
because of the extremely low temperatures of cryogenic operation, so
Rocketdyne built the LOX and LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> turbopumps to have
their ball bearings lubricated by the respective propellants. At Ohio
State University, Herrick Johnston first demonstrated the potential
of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> lubricants. The use of cryogenic lubricants in the
RL-10 paved the way for this lubrication in the
J-2.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.38">38</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">PRODUCTION AND TESTING</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In May 1963, production lines for the
operational model of the J-2 went into full swing, but concurrent
testing programs at Rocketdyne and at MSFC were also maintained
throughout the production run. Engineers from both the contractor and
the customer were on hand when Douglas began firing up S-IVB stage
hardware. The first production [<a name="148"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">148</font></b><font face="Geneva">] engine, delivered
in April 1964, went to Douglas for static tests on the S-IVB,
battleship stage at the Douglas test facility near Sacramento,
California.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The first full-duration static test of 410
seconds occurred on the battleship stand late in December. The
mission requirements of the third stage for the Saturn V called for
an application of 500 seconds, but each engine possessed a minimum
usable life of 3750 seconds. Even so, the testing program often
forced the engines beyond this. L. F. Belew, MSFC engine program
manager, characterized the philosophy of "limit testing" as a
combination of requirements for manned flight and cost control. "A
major emphasis is placed on limits testing as a means of
demonstrating reliability and confidence without a prohibitively
large test sample," he explained.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.39">39</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Intensive engine testing, including tests on
MSFC's new S-IVB test stand in Huntsville, and flight rating tests of
the 890 000-newton (200 000-pound) thrust engine for the Saturn IB
and Saturn V at Santa Susanna Field Laboratory, continued throughout
the summer of 1965. The last of the stringent qualification tests of
the J-2 engine occurred from December 1965 into January 1966,
conforming very closely to Belew's estimate. The J-2 proved its
ability to perform well over its specified operational range. One
engine ignited successfully in 30 successive firings, including five
tests at full duration of 470 seconds each. The total firing time of
3774 seconds represented a level of accumulated operational time
almost eight times greater than the flight requirements. As
successful single engine tests moved toward their climax, integration
tests of the propulsion system with the S-IVB accelerated with the
availability of more production engines. Time schedules for testing
the flight stages of the S-IVB became ever more pressing. The first
operational flight, AS-201, was scheduled in early 1966 for the
Saturn IB using the S-IB first stage and the S-IVB as the second
stage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At Sacramento, the first tests of S-IVB-201 in
July 1966 were inconclusive when a component malfunction in one of
the pneumatic consoles prematurely ended the test after a successful
propellant loading and automatic countdown. Test conductors regained
confidence on 8 August, when the S-IVB-201 performed beautifully on a
full-duration firing of 452 seconds. The test commanded extra
attention because of the first use of computers to control the entire
operational sequence, including automatic checkout, propellant
loading, and static firing.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.40">40</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The successful test was no fluke. On 26 February 1966,
AS-201 went through a flawless launch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In July 1966, NASA confirmed J-2 production
contracts through 1968, by which time Rocketdyne agreed to finish
deliveries of 155 J-2 engines. The new contract included an uprated
model of the J-2 engine with a thrust of 1 023 000 newtons (230 000
pounds). Rocketdyne began work on the uprated version in 1965 and
delivered the first engine to [<a name="149"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">149</font></b><font face="Geneva">] MSFC for testing
during the spring of 1966. Mission planners intended to use the new
engine in the second stage of the Saturn IB beginning with AS-208, as
well as the second and third stages of the Saturn V beginning with
AS-504. Meanwhile, an intensive test program continued. Following a
preliminary series of simulated altitude tests using Rocketdyne
facilities, a more stringent series of tests was conducted using the
advanced equipment of the Arnold Engineering Development Center. The
center was run by the Air Force at Tullahoma, Tennessee, not far from
MSFC. Specialists at Arnold ran a series of altitude tests on J-2
engines for the S-IVB/IB stage and followed up with an equally
successful test series on engines for the S-IVB/V in March 1967.
Using facilities that duplicated temperatures and environmental
conditions at 305 000 meters, Arnold cooperated with NASA on a string
of initial start, stop, and the crucial reignition sequences.
Throughout the year, Rocketdyne continued to test and verify the J-2
reliability at Santa Susanna. The company's research and development
program included 203 separate tests on the J-2, accumulating a total
of 33 579 seconds of firing time. In a concurrent program, production
engines from the assembly lines in the valley kept rolling up the
mountainside in trucks for their production qualification
tests.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.41">41</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">J-2 PROBLEMS AND
SOLUTIONS</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Development of the J-2 engine turned up the
inevitable gaggle of problems to perplex project designers,
engineers, and workers. In using cryogenic propellants, it was
obvious that great care was needed to ensure installation of very
efficient insulation at critical points to control thermal losses. In
the case of most early rocket technology using LOX as the oxidizer,
the problem was not immediate. Designers simply took advantage of the
fact that LOX components had a tendency to frost over. The frosty
coating worked surprisingly well as natural insulation-so well that
many components were designed without insulation from the start. The
super-cold liquid hydrogen permitted no such easy design shortcuts.
When air touched the extremely cold LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> surfaces, it did not
frost, but actually liquified. As a result, streaming liquid air not
only became an annoyance, but also created a serious heat leak. For
J-2 parts operating with LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">, it became
imperative to provide adequate insulation. Vacuum jackets sufficed
for most of the liquid hydrogen hardware, and similar treatment, or
moisture-sealed insulation, worked for pump fittings and ducts. The
main LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> inlet duct, however, presented a more intricate
challenge. The duct had to move with the gimbal action of the engine
through 10.5 degrees, maintaining a full flow of fuel all the while.
With a diameter of 20 centimeters, and a length of 53 centimeters,
the duct also experienced extension and compression of -11.4
centimeters, with a [<a name="150"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">150</font></b><font face="Geneva">] twisting, angular
movement. The final design featured a vacuum jacket built like a
double bellows, stabilized with externally mounted scissorlike
supports. Top engine program managers from NASA agreed that the
vacuum-jacketed flex inlet lines marked a significant design
achievement in the J-2.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.42">42</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The prickly, minute, intricate problems of
liquid hydrogen technology followed the design engineers down to the
last details of the J-2, including the myriad of joints where
different ducts, tubes, and lines met each other or fastened to
specified engine parts. At each juncture there existed the danger of
an LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> leak and a devastating explosion. Rather laconically,
W. R. Studhalter, one of Rocketdyne's engineers in the J-2 program,
summed up a tedious, frustrating job. "The static seals for hydrogen
had particular design attention," he said, "not only to prevent loss
under vacuum operation, but to prevent hazardous mixing of hydrogen
with air during sea-level testing and handling." To alleviate sealing
complications, he continued, "the engine design has concentrated on
the elimination of joints requiring sealing by a uniquely complete
utilization of welded connections." Some seal points were not
suitable for welding, and with specifications for zero-measurable
leakage, the J-2 team met the problem with a device known as a
"pressure-actuated combination seal." "This seal has such excellent
demonstrated performance that it is used throughout the J-2 engine,"
said Studhalter, "not only for liquid hydrogen but for liquid oxygen,
helium, and generator gas." The J-2 had 112 various seals, mostly for
instrument connections. Most were small, although the biggest
installation required a comparatively large unit for the thrust
chamber-injector seal point.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.43">43</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Modifications never seemed to end. Marshall
engineers noted that they could test components to exhaustion, but
"you would never know for sure they would work until you put them
together in the engine." Even if two engines tested successfully, a
new problem might show up on the third. There was a lot of
"cut-and-try" work to solve these complications, and the engine men
admitted that they were not always sure which "fix" corrected a
problem-or created a new one. The engineers were reconciled to a
process of changes, of trying to find out what went wrong (or what
could go wrong), and trying to correct the difficulty. "Happiness
should be finding a failure, rather than not finding a [potential]
failure," said MSFC's Bob Pease. It was accepted that many problems
would be caught after the engines were already in production. The
Saturn program always needed production hardware to meet schedules,
and the stage contractors needed engines as early as possible to
verify the fuel system, electronic compatibility, and so on. For
these reasons, drawings for production engines were released, even
though test engines were still exhibiting failures. Engineers
expected to find solutions and crank necessary changes into the
production line. Occasionally, modification kits were dispatched to
engines in the field.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.44">44</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="152"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">152</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Various areas of
concern in the production of the engine, such as reorganizing the gas
generator system sequence to refine the LOX flow and halt burned-out
gas generator walls, cropped up along the way. A more serious problem
concerned the tendency of the fuel pump to stall. After considerable
investigation, researchers isolated the problem as one of excessive
gas buildup in the thrust chamber. With the J-2's regenerative full
flow mode, a substantial volume of hydrogen gas was created when the
first fuel passed through the comparatively warm chamber. The amount
of this gas exceeded the rate of flow designed into the injector, and
this impeded the rate of flow of fuel downstream in the system while
the engine was starting. To solve the problem, the designers
developed the prechill sequence for the chamber and pumps alike and
established temperature condition limits for the engine before
attempting a start. In these and other engine difficulties, Marshall
and Rocketdyne applied all the latest analytical methods and computer
programs. It still came down to the issue of making an adjustment,
however, and then trying it out to see what
happened.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.45">45</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Rocketdyne officials hoped to utilize existing
engine facilities to test the J-2 engines and components. The unusual
characteristics of liquid hydrogen engines generated an excess of
problems in the test equipment- valves, transfer lines, and tanks
designed for the earlier liquid oxygen technology. To use
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
at -253ûC, the available equipment had to have its materials
rechecked for insulation, sealing, and embrittlement with the new
fuel. In 1961, Rocketdyne established a special cryogenic laboratory
to devote its attention exclusively to LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> paraphernalia. The
difficulties extended to numerous items of equipment such as the
piping for the LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> test-run tanks. A typical test installation included
three cryogenic tanks, one with a capacity of 307 000 liters (90 000
gallons) of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> and two smaller tanks each holding 73 000 liters (20
000 gallons) of LOX. The LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> tank was a
conventional pressure-vessel type, with the addition of a complete
vacuum jacket of unusually large design. The liquid hydrogen transfer
pipes at the test installation likewise required the vacuum jacket
treatment. For years, engineers relied on a double-wall design in
transfer pipes that used a bellows in the inside pipe to absorb
expansion and contraction. The interior bellows segment presented
difficult maintenance problems under normal cryogenic
conditions-problems that became pernicious with the introduction of
liquid hydrogen. Rocketdyne sought a new approach, and after
rejecting a number of candidates, adopted a piping design based on
the use of Invar, an alloy pipe with very low expansion
characteristics. At the time, the use of Invar piping for such
extensive cryogenic operations was the exception to the rule, and the
company perforce had to engage in extensive evaluation programs. In
its application by Rocketdyne, the use of Invar was "reduced to
practice." Invar's virtually negligible thermal contraction permitted
long inner pipe runs with no expansion mechanism at all
[<a name="153"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">153</font></b><font face="Geneva">] (although the stainless steel outer jacket retained a
bellows section for thermal movement). Rocketdyne installed 8-
centimeter and 9-centimeter pipe sizes in runs of up to 370 meters
and used some welded pipe of up to 25 centimeters in diameter.
Technicians also perfected methods for reliable ship welding and
field welds of Invar at the test sites.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#5.46">46</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">SUMMARY: RL-10 AND J-2</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The differences in thrust and mission
requirements gave the RL-10 and J-2 distinctive variations in
operating methods and specific details of design. In other ways,
there were interesting similarities. In retrospect, the development
of the RL-10 and J-2 engines progressed with remarkably few serious
hassles. The liquid-hydrogen-fueled engines, just like RP-1-fueled
engines, experienced a normal rash of complications and problem
phases. It is worth noting that despite the F-1's size and attendant
vicissitudes, Rocketdyne was fortunate in having the experience of
its H-1 engine development as a base. Although the liquid hydrogen
engines were developed and built by two different contractors, the
government managed both programs so that information from one program
was available to subsequent programs. Lewis Research Center, NASA's
facility in Cleveland, represented an interesting intermediary
influence, providing a pool of knowledge about liquid hydrogen
technology used by Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rocketdyne alike. Just as
early work at Lewis was a benefit to Pratt &amp; Whitney's RL-10,
Rocketdyne's later J-2 benefited from both Pratt &amp; Whitney and
Lewis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">It has been noted that engine development
normally preceded development of the stages, and that the engine
program often became the pacing item. The Saturn program generally
reflected this trend, although at one point it was a stage, not an
engine, that threatened to disrupt the tight schedule of
Apollo-Saturn.</font></p>
