<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="57"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">57</font></b><font face="Geneva">] At the time of
Kennedy's historic pronouncement, the booster vehicle program was
still in flux. The Saturn rocket was considered a multi-purpose
vehicle, and the Department of Defense was still planning
Earth-orbital missions using Dyna-Soar. During the summer and fall of
1960, NASA and Air Force executives were still engaged in mission
studies using Dyna-Soar as a payload for Saturn.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.1">1</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> By January 1961, the DynaSoar appeared to have won an
even stronger place in Saturn mission studies. In a planning session
at Huntsville, the second stage of the Saturn C-2 configuration study
was firmed up as to trajectory, performance, and structural
considerations. All of these parameters derived from a Saturn and
Dyna-Soar vehicle combination with the Dyna-Soar as the upper
stage.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.2">2</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Yet the C-2 configuration itself was only a paper
study, and Saturn configurations changed rapidly in the early months
of 1961.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At the opening of the new year, as NASA was
still formulating its mission plans and goals, Glennan injected a
note of caution into discussions involving a manned lunar landing
because a formal announcement from the White House had not yet been
made. In general, the mood at NASA was to proceed toward the lunar
goal along a broad base of action, leaving open a variety of options
including Department of Defense missions like Dyna-Soar. If all the
options were pursued, then a broad series of booster vehicles needed
to be developed, and von Braun was already hoisting storm signals
about the allocation of manpower in NASA programs. At current levels,
he noted, NASA would most certainly find itself overextended by
trying to maintain parallel development of both the C-2 and the
Nova.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.3">3</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="58"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">58</font></b><font face="Geneva">] During 1961,
configurations seemed to change month by month. In January, the C-1
vehicle changed from a three-stage to a two-stage booster,
eliminating the S-V upper stage to leave only S-I and S-IV stages;
but S-V development continued during February. By May, the C-1 had
become a possible three-stage vehicle again, including Block I and
Block II interim versions. In February, the C-2 was ticketed as a
three-stage vehicle for Earth-escape missions (featuring an S-II
second stage); in May, there was talk of a need for an even more
powerful vehicle for circumlunar missions; in June the C-2 was
dropped in favor of a C-3, although Nova would continue; later in the
year, there were plans for a C-4, along with a solid-booster C-1. By
the end of the year, there was also the C-5.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.4">4</a></font><font face="Geneva"> </font></sup></b><font face="Geneva">One result of
this was the decline of Dyna-Soar, whose position as a NASA payload
essentially evaporated after the C-2 cancellation in
June.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.5">5</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The rise and fall of vehicle configurations
reflected the rapidly shifting concepts of mission profiles,
payloads, schedules, and money. The fluctuating pattern of Saturn
configurations and numbers created confusion even among those in
government who were close to the program, as Hugh Dryden admitted in
a letter to Hugh Odishaw, of the National Academy of Sciences.
Written in March 1961, the letter also revealed the concern of some
observers that future development of Saturn was a "dead end road."
Such talk irritated Dryden. If critics were referring to the Saturn
S-1 first stage, with a total thrust of 1.5 million pounds, then he
admitted that maximum development was self-evident, since the
propulsion came from the most advanced engines available from the
ballistic missile program. Dryden complained that critics did not
allow for advanced Saturns of much improved performance, using what
he called "the Saturn engine."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.6">6</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> He could have been referring to either the F-1 or the
liquid hydrogen propulsion system (known as the J-2), but both types
of engine would be crucial for advanced configurations involving more
ambitious missions. The C-3 version, for example, boasted two F-1
engines in the first stage (double the thrust of the existing Saturn
C-1 first stage), four J-2 engines in the second stage, and a pair of
J-2s in the third stage. During a high-level NASA conference in late
July 1961, Milton Rosen emphasized that the United States was still
in contention in the race for a manned lunar landing "only because we
initiated J-2 and F-1 development at a relatively early date." If the
United States intended to maintain a competitive position, Rosen
warned, NASA had to capitalize on the use of these propulsion
systems, both of which were still under
development.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.7">7</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Certainly if the F-1 and J-2 were to be the
optimum engines, then the vehicle known as the Saturn C-5 promised to
be an optimum booster. The designers at MSFC made a firm commitment
to the C-5 by late 1961, [<a name="59"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">59</font></b><font face="Geneva">] and NASA
Headquarters gave formal approval for development on 25 January 1962.
The C-5 was a three-stage vehicle, with five F-1 engines in the first
stage, five J-2 liquid-hydrogen engines in the second stage, and one
J-2 in the third stage. The C-5 could handle a number of missions,
including 113 000-kilogram payloads into low Earth orbit, or 41 000
kilograms on a lunar mission, which could be a circumlunar voyage or
a manned landing.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.8">8</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During a spring meeting of various NASA
managers at Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, Ernst
Geissler of MSFC reviewed the status of the booster program. Despite
the welter of configuration changes and confusing nomenclature, one
of the guiding principles of the vehicle development program
continued to be the building block concept, an idea even more
significant with the passage of time and realization of the immense
costs and complexities of the program. "By qualifying individual
components, such as stages, a fewer number of flights are necessary
for high reliability of the total vehicle system," he emphasized.
Moreover, the step-by-step approach allowed the space agency to
experiment with various maneuvers in orbit, as required for different
mission concepts.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.9">9</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The Saturn C-1, at that time, was planned for vehicle
development launches that would also include testing of the planned
lunar spacecraft module in orbit and reentry, culminating in a series
of manned flights. The spacecraft would thus be qualified in plenty
of time, ready for launch aboard the C-5. Qualifying some of the C-5
hardware suggested possible problems, however, unless some
preliminary flight tests occurred. Geissler referred to still a
different launch vehicle, the C-IB. This interim vehicle, using the
C-5's intended third stage as its own second stage, would take
advantage of the proven C-1 first-stage booster. Thus, the C-1B would
be able to qualify certain hardware and systems for the C-5, while
demonstrating the feasibility of orbital operations inherent in C-5
mission concepts.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.10">10</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Geissler summarized three principal modes for
a lunar landing mission with the C-5 vehicle. Lunar orbit rendezvous
(LOR) involved descent to the lunar surface from lunar orbit by using
a small spacecraft that separated from a parent lunar satellite and
then rejoined the orbiting spacecraft for the return home. Earth
orbit rendezvous (EOR) involved the landing of a larger vehicle
directly on the lunar surface, thus eliminating the descent and
ascent of a separate spacecraft from orbit. But the EOR mode required
rendezvous techniques in building up the necessary vehicle in Earth
orbit. Geissler explained two different approaches. After launching
two vehicles, the upper stages of each could be connected to form the
lunar vehicle. An alternative was to transfer oxidizer from one
vehicle to the other in Earth orbit. There was one more feasible way
of going to the moon: if a large enough vehicle could be built, a
single launch would suffice. MSFC refused to give up on Nova. The
Nova in the spring of 1962 was to have 8-10 F-1 engines in the first
stage, and a.... </font></p>

engine, the M-1, under development by Aerojet General. Although
Geissler predicted a test launch of the Nova by the autumn of 1967,
the logic of development favored the C-5 because it was predicted to
be fully operational by November 1967.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.11">11</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Nova, like Dyna-Soar, seemed to evaporate as
other issues were settled that placed a premium on the development of
its nearest competitor, the C-5. On 11 July 1962, NASA officially
endorsed the C-1B as a two-stage Saturn for Earth-orbital tests of
Apollo hardware. At the same time, NASA confirmed the choice of the
LOR mode for the lunar mission, thereby focusing development on the
C-5. Early in 1963, NASA Headquarters announced a new nomenclature
for its large launch vehicles. The C-1 became Saturn I, C-1B became
Saturn IB, and C-5 became Saturn V. Nova was not even
mentioned.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.12">12</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">....engagements among various NASA centers and
within Headquarters. The struggle in reaching the final decision also
suggested some of the problems to be faced by NASA management when
one center had responsibility for the launch vehicle and another
organization had the payload. The problems were compounded when both
were trying to fashion programs and develop hardware without always
knowing what each would require in the end.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The von Braun group, after all, had been
developing both payload and boosters as integral systems for years.
Now it would be necessary to defer to different design teams and
accept outside judgments about payloads. In the case of Saturn, the
payload development stemmed from the Space Task Group (STG)
originally set up in October 1958 to manage Project Mercury. Located
physically at Langley Research Center, Virginia, STG reported to the
Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Maryland. Beginning in
1959, STG received management responsibilities for studies leading to
Project Apollo.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.13">13</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> In the spring of 1960, STG and MSFC began closer
contact when STG organized a special liaison group, the "Advanced
Vehicle Team," nine men headed by R.O. Piland and reporting directly
to the STG chief, Robert R. Gilruth. Among other things, the Advanced
Vehicle Team was to maintain appropriate contact with the various
NASA centers, and, specifically, to maintain "the necessary liaison
with the Marshall Space Flight Center in matters
[<a name="62"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">62</font></b><font face="Geneva">] pertaining to the development and planned use of
boosters in the advanced manned space flight
program."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.14">14</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Early on, participants in the liaison effort
discovered that their style did not always mesh with that of MSFC.
One trip report from an STG team member in October 1960 noted von
Braun's desire for additional meetings in November and December, and
added, somewhat peevishly, "Dr. von Braun wants to participate. This
probably means another ballroom meeting." Apparently the MSFC method
was to have a large gathering for a semiformal presentation, then
break into smaller groups for detailed discussions. "I've reached the
opinion that MSFC staff have no qualms about playing one group
against the other... if we have separate meetings," the correspondent
complained, and warned STG to be careful.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.15">15</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Perhaps part of the problem was STG's lesser
standing vis-a-vis Marshall as a full-fledged center. This aspect was
improved in January 1960, when STG became a separate field element,
reporting directly to the NASA Director of Space Flight Programs, Abe
Silverstein. As Director of STG, Gilruth had his own staff of some
600, still physically located at Langley. With a new organizational
structure and bureaucratic independence, STG was authorized to
conduct advanced planning studies for manned vehicle systems, as well
as to establish basic design criteria. STG also had authority to
assume technical management of its projects, including the monitoring
of contractors. By November, STG became even more independent when it
was officially redesignated the Manned Spacecraft Center
(MSC),</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.16">16</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> and plans were being made to transfer MSC to its new
location near Houston, Texas, by the middle of 1962.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">It is interesting that Gilruth and von Braun's
emissary, Eberhard Rees, soon thereafter were stressing the
"equality" of the two NASA centers. Meeting in July 1961, the two men
also agreed on setting up four joint panels to cope with the growing
problems of design, hardware, operational, and bureaucratic
coordination: Program Planning Scheduling; Launch Operations;
Apollo-Advanced Vehicles; Apollo-Saturn C-1. Each panel, in addition,
included certain working groups for specific areas, with provisions
for ad hoc joint study groups as the need arose. For problems
involving other NASA agencies, there were special technical liaison
teams. In general, technically knowledgeable members were assigned on
a functional, rather than an organizational, basis; wherever
possible, the responsibilities of experienced personnel already
assigned to internal working groups were
increased.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.17">17</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Naturally, all concerned hoped that the joint
groups would promote understanding and reduce friction. That the
Apollo-Saturn program succeeded as well as it did testifies to the
value of such efforts, but this is [<a name="63"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">63</font></b><font face="Geneva">] not to say that
differences of opinion were always easily and quickly adjusted. The
issue of EOR versus LOR, for example, brought Marshall and the Manned
Spacecraft Center into head-on conflict.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Early in 1961, NASA's studies for a manned
lunar landing were keyed to the EOR mode using a Saturn vehicle or to
direct ascent with the Nova.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.38">18</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> In view of MSC's later acceptance of LOR, Gilruth's
initial support of the direct ascent concept is intriguing. "I feel
that it is highly desirable to develop a launch vehicle with
sufficient performance and reliability to carry out the lunar landing
mission using the direct approach," he wrote to NASA Headquarters
reliability expert Nicholas Golovin in the autumn of 1961. As for the
rendezvous schemes (and here he apparently referred only to EOR),
Gilruth said that they compromised mission reliability and flight
safety, and that they were a "crutch to achieve early planned dates
for launch vehicle availability, and to avoid the difficulty of
developing a reliable Nova Class launch vehicle." At the same time,
he understood the need for an Earth parking orbit during any mission
to allow adequate time for final checkout of spacecraft, equipment,
and crew readiness before going far from Earth.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.19">19</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The concept of lunar orbital rendezvous (LOR)
had been studied at Langley Research Center as early as 1960. The
idea was passionately advocated by John Houbolt, a Langley engineer
who first encountered it while investigating rendezvous techniques
for orbiting space stations. The Langley-Houbolt concept of LOR was
soon absorbed by the STG-MSC crew, and MSC eventually became the
leading champion of LOR.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.20">20</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Houbolt played a key role in converting Headquarters
planners to the LOR concept. Convinced that the idea had not received
a fair hearing, Houbolt bypassed everyone and wrote directly to
Associate Administrator Robert C. Seamans, Jr., in November.
Fulminating at what he viewed as grandiose plans for using boosters
that were too large and lunar landers that were too complex, Houbolt
urged consideration of LOR as a simple, cost-effective scheme with
high likelihood of success. "Give us the go-ahead, and a C-3,"
Houbolt pleaded, "and we will put man on the moon in very short
order."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.21">21</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Houbolt's letter apparently swayed several
managers at Headquarters, especially George Low, Director of Space
Craft and Flight Missions, in the Office of Manned Space Flight
(OMSF). But D. Brainerd Holmes, who presided over OMSF, still had a
prickly managerial problem. There remained people at Headquarters
with doubts about LOR, principally Milton Rosen, newly named Director
of Launch Vehicles and Propulsion in OMSF. Early in November, Holmes
and Seamans directed Rosen to prepare a summary report on the large
launch vehicle program, which of necessity dealt with the issue of
EOR-LOR-direct ascent. The Rosen study came on top of several other
committee reports on vehicles and.... </font></p>

Rosen's group of 11 people, including 3 from MSFC (Willy Mrazek, Hans
Maus, and James Bramlet), submitted its report on 20
November.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.22">22</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The issue of how to achieve a lunar landing at
the earliest date became a principal theme in the Rosen group's
deliberations. Although rendezvous offered an early possibility of a
manned lunar landing, Rosen's working group noted that actual
rendezvous and docking experience would not be available until 1964.
LOR also seemed the riskiest and most tricky of the rendezvous modes,
and the group expressed a decided preference for EOR. Either way, a
C-5 Saturn with five F-1 engines in the first stage was the
recommended vehicle. In spite of all the discussion of rendezvous,
the Rosen committee in the end favored direct ascent as opposed to
either EOR or LOR. "The United States should place primary emphasis
on the direct flight mode for achieving the first manned lunar
landing," the report flatly stated. "This mode gives greater
assurance of accomplishment during this decade." Therefore, the Nova
vehicle "should be developed on a top priority
basis."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.23">23</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The trend toward LOR strengthened, however. Even
though EOR became the "working mode" for budgetary planning for 1962,
the debate went on.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Holmes hired Joseph Shea, an energetic young
engineer, as Chief of the Office of Systems Engineering in OMSF, with
responsibilities to conduct and coordinate mission mode studies.
Holmes also instituted a top-level series of meetings under the
rubric of "The Management Council," to discuss issues involving
Headquarters and more than just one center alone.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.24">24</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> At just about every meeting of the Management Council,
Rosen and Gilruth got into a debate over the mode choice. Finally, as
Rosen recalled, Gilruth came up to him after one of the meetings had
adjourned and made one more pitch for the LOR mode. The most
dangerous phase of the mission, Gilruth argued, was the actual
landing on the moon. If Rosen's direct ascent idea was followed, then
at the moment for lunar descent, that meant landing an unwieldy
vehicle that was both quite long and quite heavy. A very touchy
operation, Gilruth emphasized. LOR, on the other hand, boasted an
important advantage: the lunar landing and lunar takeoff would be
accomplished by a very light and maneuverable vehicle specifically
designed for the task. Rosen confessed he had been preoccupied with
simplicity from one end of the mission-the launch from Earth-and he
had no convincing counterarguments when Gilruth made him look at
simplicity from the other end, the lunar landing.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.25">25</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">While the consensus at Headquarters now
shifted towards LOR, the split between MSC and MSFC showed few signs
of easing. On a swing through both MSC at Langley and MSFC at
Huntsville in January 1962, Shea was discouraged by the entrenched
position of the two centers: Marshall people displayed an
"instinctive reaction" of negativism on the
[<a name="66"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">66</font></b><font face="Geneva">] issue of LOR, while MSC personnel seemed too
enthusiastic, even unrealistic, about rendezvous problems and the
weight situation. Each center, Shea observed, intent on its own
in-house studies, "completely ignores the capability of the other's
hardware."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.26">26</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> During the spring, however, MSC's research seemed to
become more convincing. MSFC also began to regard LOR with increased
interest. In mid-April, an MSC presentation at Huntsville elicited
several favorable comments from von Braun
himself.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.27">27</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The evidence suggests that von Braun
increasingly felt the necessity of settling the issue so that they
could get on with definitive contracts for launch vehicles and other
hardware with long lead times.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.28">28</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Resolution of the EOR-LOR controversy finally came on
7 June 1962, when Shea and his aides were in Huntsville for still
another session on the mode of rendezvous. In his concluding remarks,
von Braun noted that the conference had given six hours of intensive
analysis to various proposals, including Nova-direct as well as EOR
and LOR. They all appeared to be feasible, von Braun commented; the
problem was narrowing the choices to one and then acting on it. "It
is absolutely mandatory that we arrive at a definite mode decision
within the next few weeks, preferably by the first of July 1962," he
declared. "We are already losing time in our overall program as a
result of lacking a mode decision." Then von Braun announced that LOR
was Marshall's first choice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">There were complex technological, economic,
and administrative reasons for Marshall's ultimate decision to go
along with LOR. Although von Braun elaborated on 11 principal reasons
for choosing LOR, the basic consideration involved confidence that it
provided the best chance for a successful manned lunar landing within
the decade. The concept promised good performance margins. Separation
of the lunar lander from the reentry vehicle seemed desirable from
many considerations of design and operation, and the overall concept
suggested good growth potential for both the lander and the booster.
Von Braun also implied that both sides could work together without
the potential friction of an "I told you so" attitude. The fact that
he felt compelled to proffer such a verbal olive branch suggests that
the heat generated by the EOR-LOR debate must have been considerable.
The MSFC Director observed that "the issue of 'invented here' versus
'invented there' does not apply," because both MSC and MSFC, in
effect, adopted an approach originally put forth by Langley. "I
consider it fortunate indeed for the Manned Lunar Landing Program
that both Centers, after much soul searching, have come to identical
conclusions," von Braun emphasized. "This should give the Office of
Manned Space Flight some additional assurance that our
recommendations should not be too far from the truth."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Quickly ticking off the reasons for deciding
against EOR, von Braun pointed out that it was still feasible. A
looming negative factor was the double loss incurred if, for example,
the tanker launch went just fine, but
[<a name="67"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">67</font></b><font face="Geneva">] the manned launch was postponed too long on the pad
or had to abort during ascent, wiping out the mission to the cost of
two complete launch vehicles and associated launch expenses. In
addition, von Braun noted complex management and interface problems
with dual launches. Using the C-5 in a direct launch posed some
thorny technical problems and permitted only the thinnest margins in
weight allowances for the spacecraft, so the C-5 direct route was
rejected. The huge Nova booster could have solved some of these
problems, but it was rejected principally because of its size, which
would have created requirements beyond the existing scope of
fabrication and test facilities available to NASA; there were also
serious problems seen in time, funding, and technical demands for a
booster of Nova's dimensions.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.29">29</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Even with von Braun's imprimatur in June, the
irrevocable decision for LOR did not come until the end of 1962. The
Huntsville conclave produced agreement at the center level only; NASA
Headquarters still had to formalize the choice and implement the
decision. Early in July, Seamans, Dryden, Webb, and Holmes concurred
with a recommendation for LOR by the Manned Space Flight Management
Council, but the President's Scientific Advisory Committee still
actively questioned the LOR mode. The committee evidently preferred
the EOR approach because it felt the technological development
inherent in the EOR concept had more promise in the long run for
civil and military operations; its argument also suggested that the
LOR choice stemmed from internal NASA expediency-as the cheapest and
earliest mission possibility-even though technical analysis of LOR
was incomplete. Nicholas Golovin and Jerome Wiesner, in particular,
remained adamantly against LOR, and the controversy actually boiled
over into a public exchange between Wiesner and NASA officials at
Huntsville while President Kennedy was touring Marshall Space Flight
Center in September.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Host von Braun and the President were standing
in front of a chart showing the LOR maneuver sequence. As von Braun
proceeded to explain the details, Kennedy interrupted, "I understand
Dr. Wiesner doesn't agree with this," and turned around to search the
entourage of newsmen and VIPs around them, "Where is Jerry?" Kennedy
demanded, Wiesner came up to join Kennedy and von Braun, with Webb,
Seamans, and Holmes also in the group. Wiesner proceeded to outline
his objections to LOR, and some lively dialogue ensued, just out of
the earshot of straining newsmen and dozens of onlookers on the other
side of a roped-off aisle. "They obviously knew we were discussing
something other than golf scores," Seamans recalled. In fairness to
Wiesner, Seamans later noted, the President's scientific advisor had
to play the devil's advocate on many issues when a robust agency was
vigorously pressing its position. Wiesner's job was to make sure that
the President received alternative views, and he once confided to
Seamans that he was.... </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The Saturn program created a vast new
aerospace enterprise, partly private and partly public, with MSFC
directing a group of facilities whose extent far exceeded anything in
the days of the old NACA. The federally owned facilities under
Marshall's immediate jurisdiction eventually included the sprawling
installation at Huntsville; the cavernous Michoud Assembly Facility
(MAF) at New Orleans; the huge Mississippi Test Facility (MTF) at Bay
St. Louis, Mississippi; and the Slidell Computer Facility at Slidell,
Louisiana. Other government-owned facilities directly related to the
Saturn program included the NASA Rocket Engine Test Site at Edwards
[<a name="69"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">69</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Air Force Base in California and the government-owned
production facilities for the S-II second stage at Seal Beach,
California.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The growth of Marshall Space Flight Center at
Huntsville began almost as soon as the transfer of the von Braun team
from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency in 1960. This shift involved
some 4.8 square kilometers of land (within the 162 square kilometers
of the Redstone Arsenal) and facilities valued at $96 000 000, along
with 4670 employees from ABMA's Development Operations Division. (For
subsequent figures on manpower, plant value, etc., see the
appendixes.) Settling in its new role, MSFC evolved as a facility of
three distinct sectors, divided into an administrative and planning
area, an industrial area, and test area. Although the transfer gave
NASA the bulk of the land and facilities previously used by ABMA's
Development Operations Division, von Braun's administrative staff was
allowed to remain in their old ABMA offices on a temporary basis
only, and a Saturn-sized test area was needed. Construction began on
a new administrative complex and the first MSFC personnel took
occupancy during the spring of 1963. Of the several approaches to the
center, perhaps the most impressive was from the north. Driving
several miles through the green pastures and wooded, rolling hills of
the Alabama countryside, a viewer watched the administrative complex
looming ever larger. Three multistory buildings were arranged in a
"V" shape, with Building 4200, the tallest of the three, proudly
riding the crest of a low hill. With the U.S. flag snapping smartly
from its pole, this impressive office complex rising out of the rural
landscape rarely failed to impress visitors. As director of the
Marshall Space Flight Center, von Braun, with his staff, occupied
office suites on the top two floors of Building 4200, irreverently
known as the "von Braun Hilton."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Once over the crest of the hill, the visitor
saw the rest of the Marshall complex stretching for several miles to
the Tennessee River. In the foreground, the former ABMA laboratories
and manufacturing areas occupied the equivalent of many city blocks.
The labs incorporated facilities for a host of esoteric research
projects, computation, astrionics, test, and other specialized
research activities. Buildings for manufacturing, engineering,
quality and reliability assurance, and others had cavernous, high bay
areas attached to accommodate the outsized Saturn components. In the
background, the skyline was punctuated by the silhouettes of the
assorted test stands and other installations of the expanded test
area. Here were the engine test stands, an F-1 engine turbopump test
position, and two especially large installations visible for miles.
One was the big, burly test stand for the S-IC first stage, 123
meters high, completed in 1964. The second was the Dynamic Test
Stand, 129 meters high, designed to accommodate the complete Saturn
"stack" of all three booster stages, the instrument unit, and the
Apollo spacecraft. Inside the Dynamic Test Stand, heavy duty
equipment shook [<a name="70"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">70</font></b><font face="Geneva">] and pounded the
vehicle to determine its bending and vibration characteristics during
flight. Still further to the south, specially built roads for
transporting the bulky Saturn flight stages led to docking facilities
on the Tennessee River, where barges picked up or dropped off stages
en route to other test sites or launch facilities at Cape
Kennedy.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.32">32</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Except for the lawns and plantings around the
administrative complex, Huntsville always had a factory look about
it. Crisscrossed by streets and railroad tracks, Marshall still bore
the stamp of its heritage as an Army arsenal, with lean, utilitarian
structures, linked together by a web of electric and phone lines
supported by ubiquitous poles. Buildings in the industrial area were
frequently flanked by ranks of high-pressure gas bottles, cranes,
hoists, and assorted large rocket components. A visit to the Manned
Spacecraft Center at Houston, with its sleek, ultramodern office
complexes and well-tailored inner courtyards (complete with ponds and
rocky little streams) was a study in contrasts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">When Marshall was organized in 1960, the Army
launch team under the direction of Kurt Debus became the Launch
Operations Directorate, Marshall Space Flight Center. At the Army's
Missile Firing Laboratory, the Debus team had been launching a series
of Army vehicles, including Redstone and Jupiter, and had launched
the first American Earth satellite, Explorer I. In the months
following the transfer to NASA, they launched the manned
Mercury-Redstone suborbital flights. As plans for the Saturn series
were finalized, the Launch Operation Directorate, through Debus,
participated in the search for a new launch site, large enough and
removed far enough from population centers to satisfy the physical
requirements of the big new space boosters. Cape Canaveral was
chosen, and development of the new facilities began, with Launch
Complex 34 becoming operational during the fall of 1961 to launch the
first Saturn I vehicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The immense task of constructing new launch
pads and developing the huge installations required for Saturn V
operations called for a separate administrative entity. In March
1962, NASA announced plans to establish a new Launch Operations
Center (LOC) at the Cape, and the change became effective on 1 July
1962. While close liaison continued, launch operations ceased to be a
prime responsibility of MSFC, and Kurt Debus proceeded as Director,
LOC, to develop the launch facilities for the Apollo-Saturn
program.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.33">33</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Large as it was, the aerospace complex at MSFC
could not begin to accommodate the escalating dimensions of the
Saturn program. Consistent with its heritage as an Army arsenal with
an extensive in-house capability, Marshall manufactured the first
eight models of Saturn I's first stage and did the testing in its
backyard. The physical size of other Saturn stages, the frequency of
testing as production models came on line, and the sheer magnitude of
the endeavor dictated the need for additional facilities located
elsewhere. Each major contractor developed the.... </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">....special industrial capabilities required
for the unique sizes inherent in the Saturn program, including
fabrication, manufacturing, and testing. There was a certain
kaleidoscopic aura about all these arrangements, since some were
accomplished entirely by the contractor on privately owned premises
and others were undertaken in government-owned facilities, with the
contractor supplying most of the work force.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">For example, the Saturn IB and Saturn V first
stages were manufactured at the Michoud Assembly Facility (known
familiarly as "Michoud") 24 kilometers east of downtown New Orleans.
The prime contractors, Chrysler and Boeing, respectively, jointly
occupied Michoud's 186 000 square meters of manufacturing floor space
and 68 000 square meters of office space. The basic manufacturing
building, one of the largest in the country, boasted 43 acres under
one roof. By 1964, NASA added a separate engineering and office
building, vertical assembly [<a name="72"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">72</font></b><font face="Geneva">] building, (for the
S-IC) and test stage building (also for the S-IC). By 1966, other
changes to the site included enlarged barge facilities and other
miscellaneous support buildings. Two things remained unchanged: a
pair of chimneys in front of the Administration Building, remnants of
an old sugar plantation. These ungainly artifacts served as reminders
of Michoud's checkered past, from a plantation grant by the King of
France in 1763, to ownership by the wealthy but eccentric New Orleans
recluse and junk dealer, Antoine Michoud. Never a successful
plantation, its sometime production of lumber and other local
resources from the swampy environs helped generate the local slogan,
"from muskrats to moonships."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The plant itself dated back to World War II,
when it was built to produce Liberty ships. A hiatus in contract
agreements shifted the emphasis to cargo planes, but only two C-46
transports rolled out before the war ended. The government facility
remained essentially inactive until the Korean War, when the Chrysler
Corporation employed over 2000 workers to build engines for Army
tanks. Dormant since 1954, the building had been costing the
government $140 000 per year to keep up. With so many jobs in the
offing and the obvious level of economic activity to be generated by
the manufacture of large rocket boosters, selection of the site
occurred in a highly charged political atmosphere, with active
lobbying by a number of congressmen and chambers of commerce from
around the country. Eventual selection of the Michoud facility in
1961 followed a series of thorough NASA investigations, and Michoud
easily fulfilled several high-priority considerations: production
space and availability; location near a major metropolitan area;
convenient year-round water transport facilities (to haul the
oversized Saturn stages); and reasonable proximity to MSFC, the Cape,
and a contemplated test-firing site for the finished
stages.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.34">34</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The extent of computer services required for
the activities at the Mississippi Test Facility and Michoud prompted
MSFC managers to consider a major computer installation to serve both
operations. Happily, a location was found that included a structure
originally designed to support sophisticated electronic operations.
At Slidell, Louisiana, 32 kilometers northeast of Michoud and 24
kilometers southwest of MTF, Marshall acquired a modern facility
originally built by the Federal Aviation Administration. For
modifications and installation of new equipment, MSFC spent over $2
000 000 after acquiring the site in the summer of 1962. The array of
digital and analog computers for test, checkout, simulation, and
engineering studies made it one of the largest computer installations
in the country.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.35">35</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In contrast to Michoud, where the plant
facility sat waiting, the development of the Mississippi Test
Facility became a contest with Mississippi mud-to say nothing of the
poisonous snakes and clouds of mosquitoes that plagued construction
workers. Although NASA began [<a name="73"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">73</font></b><font face="Geneva">] with a list of 34
potential locations, the site for test-firing Saturn V rocket stages
logically had to be close to the production facilities at Michoud and
also be accessible by water for shipment of S-II stages. Other
criteria quickly ruled out most of the other contending sites. The
test area had to be big. Size was a safety factor; test sites had to
be widely separated from critical support and supply facilities in
case of accidental destruction of a stage during a test run. More
important, at the time the test facility location was being debated,
NASA designers were looking ahead to big, deep-space booster stages
of up to 111 million newtons (25 million pounds) of thrust, and lots
of noise. Therefore, a test area of expansive proportions was
required but in a location where a minimum number of people would
have to be relocated. After juggling all of these requirements, in
October 1961 NASA settled on a sparsely populated corner of Hancock
County, Mississippi. A new, $300-million-plus space-age facility was
hacked out of soggy cypress groves, Devil's Swamp, Dead Tiger Creek,
and the Pearl River. By the intracoastal waterway and the Pearl
River, MTF was only a 72-kilometer barge trip from the production
facilities at Michoud, and was accessible by water to MSFC and the
Cape.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The central test area, around the test stands,
comprised 55 square kilometers, with a buffer zone of 518 square
kilometers surrounding it. Approximately 850 families from five small
hamlets were resettled outside MTF boundaries. The central test area
was exclusively reserved for NASA use, and although the buffer zone
was uninhabited, the area continued to be lumbered and teemed with
wildlife, including wild hogs descended from abandoned farm stock. An
employee picnic in 1967 frugally consigned some of these natural
resources to a barbecue pit.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.36">36</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At the heart of MTF were the monolithic test
stands: a dual-position structure for running the S-IC stage at full
throttle, and two separate stands for the S-II stage. Laboratories,
monitoring equipment, control center, and storage areas, including
docks, were all deployed thousands of meters away. The MTF complex
was tied together by 12 kilometers of canals (with navigation locks
and a bascule bridge); 45 kilometers of railroads; and 56 kilometers
of roads and paved highways. Under it all snaked 966 kilometers of
cables, connecting test stands, laboratories, and data banks. Each
month, MTF consumed enough electricity to keep 6000 households
functioning.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">An arm of MSFC at Huntsville, MTF had an
administrative pattern that was a bit unusual. A comparatively small
cadre of NASA personnel (about 100) carried out overall managerial
and supervisory duties. This select group also made the final
evaluation of test results and issued the flight-worthiness
certificates to the stage contractors. Approximately 3000 contractor
personnel made up the vast majority of the work force. North American
and Boeing each had several hundred people running their respective
test stands. The General Electric Company, with over 1500 people, had
the contract for housekeeping services at MTF and
[<a name="74"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">74</font></b><font face="Geneva">] provided maintenance for the facility and operational
support at the test stands and elsewhere for the other tenants,
including the construction firms. GE's range of support ran the gamut
from 19 special items of cable equipment (for $ 1 183 187), to the
always popular snake bite kits ($1.25 each). On occasion, GE hired
cowboys to round up stray cattle in the outreaches of MTF, and it was
GE that arranged for the transfer of the cemeteries during
resettlement of the area's small towns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Development of MTF had a hectic air about it.
Construction delays mounted by early 1964, after Mississippi went
through a highly unusual cold snap and a snowstorm. Heavy rains came
during January, topping records that had been on the books for 30
years. The schedules for construction and testing merged to the point
where the first test firings in 1966 were being planned concurrently
with ongoing construction. The MTF director, Jack Balch, observed:
"We're sure this is the only way to do it, but for the next year
we'll be riding with one foot on each of two galloping horses." The
government-industry team at MTF did the job; the first stage-firing
test, a 15-second test of the S-II stage, was performed successfully
on 23 April 1966 in the test stand designated A-2. On 3 March 1967, a
15-second test of the S-IC-T (test) stage activated the first-stage
facility. In September 1967, the other S-II stand, designated A-1,
was declared operational.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.37">37</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">While these facilities were being developed,
MSFC drew on experience, accumulated during the days of ABMA and the
Army's arsenal concept, and developed the Saturn I-the vehicle
originally designated as Juno V. On the threshold of starting to work
on the large Juno V class of vehicles and other space hardware in
1959, Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, von Braun's chief scientific advisor at
ABMA, briefed NASA officials on the range of expected challenges and
research required to develop vehicle components for space
exploration. He noted the potential hazards from radiation, meteors,
temperature extremes, and weightlessness. To cope with these
environments, Stuhlinger stressed the need for research on a broad
front, including special investigation into a list of 11 crucial
materials and their current shortcomings in the space environment-
from the decomposition of dielectrics and sealants, to unusual
regimes of friction and wear for bearings and various moving parts,
to the degradation of plastic and exposed surfaces, and to the
vaporization and vacuum sticking of metals.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.38">38</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Specific investigation of these and other problems
moved on parallel tracks with the integration of components and
materials into the launch vehicle design, even while the launch
vehicle itself was taking form on drawing boards and in machine
shops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="76"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">76</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Like most major
development projects, the evolution of the Saturn I changed between
conception and execution, although the configuration that emerged in
1958 was subjected to remarkably few major design variations before
its first launch in 1961. The basic outlines for ABMA's concepts of
the Saturn I (when it was still called Juno V) were sketched out in
two reports to Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in October
and November 1958; insights on various aspects of early design
choices were provided by von Braun himself in ABMA's presentation to
NASA in December 1958. For example, original concepts for yaw, pitch,
and roll control called for hinged outer engines: two hinged for
pitch; two hinged for yaw; all four for roll. But application of
adequate control forces required fairly high deflection of the engine
thrust vector, and the engine contractor (Rocketdyne) complained that
this would put too much stress on propellant flex lines. Instead,
gimbaling of all four outer engines was adopted, achieving adequate
control force with less engine deflection. The gimbal system for
mounting engines permitted each engine in the cluster to swivel about
for either yaw or pitch control.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">On the other hand, the original multiengine
concept was maintained. Throughout the early design phase, ABMA
stressed the reliability of the multiengine approach in case one or
even two were lost. Particularly in the case of manned missions, von
Braun emphasized, the engine-out capability offered much higher
margins of safety in continuing a mission until conditions were less
hazardous for separation of the crew capsule.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The multitank design also persisted as a
design choice. In his NASA presentation, von Braun praised the
multitank design for several reasons. Component tanks could be flown
by Douglas C-124 Globemasters to any part of the world and
reassembled for launch; this procedure would provide a high degree of
flexibility. The separate tanks eliminated the technical difficulties
of internal horizontal bulkheads, required in a large tank vehicle,
to keep fuel and oxidizer separate. It also meant a shorter, and more
desirable, vehicle. In spite of the added weight, most rocket
propellant tanks included internal fuel slosh baffles, because
splashing and surging of the liquid fuel created problems in keeping
the vehicle stable and under control. In 1958, von Braun predicted
that no fuel slosh baffles would be required in the multitank design
because of the small diameter of the individual tanks (although the
flight versions actually incorporated slosh baffles in their design).
A great deal of attention was also given to booster recovery schemes,
in which the spent first stage would be recovered from the ocean
after its descent had been slowed by retrorockets and parachutes. The
Huntsville group foresaw immense savings in the recovery scheme,
since the illustration given by von Braun assumed "5 or 19 years from
now" a launch rate of 100 vehicles per year over a 5-year period, at
a cost of about $10 million per launch.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.39">39</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="77"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">77</font></b><font face="Geneva">] More than any of the
Saturn vehicles, the Saturn I S-I stage configuration evolved during
flight tests (for details, see </font><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch11.htm">chapter 11</a></font><font face="Geneva">). NASA developed the Saturn I as first-generation and
second-generation rockets, designated Block I and Block II. The first
four launches used the Block I vehicle, with inert upper stages and
no fins on the first stage, the S-I. Block II versions carried a live
second stage, the S-IV, sported a corolla of aerodynamic fins at the
base, and used uprated H-I engines. The S-I first stage for the
Saturn I also became the first stage of the Saturn IB; in this
application, it was called the S-IB. Again, there were modifications
to the fins, engines, and various internal components. Nevertheless,
the basic details of fabrication and testing of the Saturn I and
Saturn IB remained similar. The first stage of the Saturn I and IB
may have looked like a plumber's nightmare, but it fit the criteria
of conservative design and economy established early in the program.
As Marshall engineers discovered, development of a new booster of
Saturn I's size involved a number of design problems. Fabrication of
the tankage was comparatively easy. Even though the former Redstone
and Jupiter tanks had to be lengthened from 12 to 16 meters to carry
added propellants, the basic diameters of the 178-centimeter Redstone
and 267-centimeter Jupiter tanks were retained, so they could be
fabricated from the tooling and welding equipment still available at
Huntsville. The tank arrangement settled on by MSFC gave an alternate
pattern of the four fuel and four oxidizer tanks, clustered around
the 267-centimeter center oxidizer tank. The oxidizer tanks carried
the load from the upper stages of the Saturn, the fuel tanks only
contributing to the lateral stiffness of the cluster. When filled,
the oxidizer tanks contracted 63.5 millimeters, which meant that the
fuel tanks had to have slip joints at their upper ends to accommodate
other structural elements that fluctuated with the tank shrinkage.
All together, the Saturn I first stage carried 340 000 kilograms of
propellants in its nine tanks. To keep the propellant in one tank
from depleting too rapidly during flight, which would seriously
unbalance the vehicle, the Saturn I incorporated an interconnecting
pipe system, with regulating equipment to keep propellants at uniform
level in all tanks during a mission. Each of the four outboard fuel
tanks fed two engines, yet interconnected with the other tanks. The
267-centimeter center liquid-oxygen (LOX) tank provided series flow
to the four outboard LOX tanks, which also fed two engines
apiece.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Although the group of tanks eased the
potential slosh tendencies of a single large tank, each separate
cylinder contained fixed baffles, running accordionlike down the tank
interiors. Pressurization for the LOX tanks was done by a heat
exchanger, dumping it into the top of the LOX tanks as gaseous
oxygen. Gaseous nitrogen from fiberglass spheres at the top of the
booster pressurized the fuel tanks. The 48 spheres fixed to the top
of the stage were curiously reminiscent of bunches of grapes.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The cluster of tanks was held together at the
base by the tail section [<a name="78"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">78</font></b><font face="Geneva">] and at the top by an
aptly named structural component known as the "spider beam." The tail
section consisted of the thrust structure assembly as well as the
heat shield, shrouding for engine components, holddown points,
stabilizing fins (on the later Saturn I first stages), and other
components. </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Assembly of the spider beam required a special
fixture for precise alignment and joining of the heavy aluminum l
beams, of which it was made. Starting with a hub assembly, eight
radial beams were attached to it at 45-degree intervals. Then eight
more cross beams were joined to the outer ends of the radials with
splice plates. The spider beam played a dual role. Special hardware
attached to it was used during the initial clustering of the tanks.
In other words, the spider beam served as an assembly fixture, then
remained as part of the stage's permanent structural assemblies, with
each outboard oxidizer tank affixed to the beam. Because a smaller
diameter upper stage of 5.6 meters was planned for the Saturn I, an
upper shroud was incorporated as part of the structural transition
from the larger 6.5-meter-diameter first stage. The upper shroud also
enclosed telemetry equipment, umbilical connection points used in
ground test and launch preparation, and space for the recovery system
for the first stage. In the later versions (the Block II models), the
shroud section was eliminated, and instruments were housed in a
separate instrument segment atop the upper stage. The recovery
section was no longer required; additional studies, completed by
early 1962, indicated that the recovery scheme would require
extensive modification to the stage, so the idea was finally
dropped.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.40">40</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the process of refining the design of the
Saturn I, two major problems emerged: stability and base heating. As
with most large rockets, the Saturn I was highly unstable, with the
overall center of gravity located on the heavy, lower-stage booster,
while the center of lift, in most flight conditions, was high on the
upper stages. The nature of the problem called for more advanced
control processes than used on aircraft and rockets the size of
ICBMs. The low natural frequency of the big vehicle was such that
when the gimbaled engines moved to correct rocket motions, special
care had to be taken not to amplify the motions because the control
system frequency was close to that of the vehicle itself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">More worrisome, at least in the early design
stage, was the problem of base heating. Even with a rocket powered by
only one engine, the flow pattern at its base proved nearly
impossible to predict for the various combinations of speed and
altitude. Base heating occurred when the rocket exhaust interacted
with the shock waves trailing behind the vehicle. This clash created
unpredictable regions of dead air and zones of turbulent mixing.
Heated by the rocket exhaust, the air trapped in these areas in turn
raised the heat levels at the base of the rocket to undesirable
temperatures. Worse, the fuel-rich exhaust flow from the engine
turbopump could get caught in these "hot-spot" regions, causing fire
or explosion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="79"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">79</font></b><font face="Geneva">] The base heating
phenomenon became worse with multiengine rockets. The eight-engine
Saturn I cluster began to look like a Pandora's box of base heating.
To get an idea of what to expect, and to work out some fixes ahead of
time, the Saturn design team ran some cold flow tests, using
scale-model hardware, and called on NASA's Lewis Research Center, in
Cleveland, to run some unusual wind tunnel tests. These
investigations involved a booster model with eight operating engines,
each putting out 1100 newtons (250 pounds) of thrust. Following the
tests and extensive theoretical studies, designers in Huntsville came
up with several ideas to cope with the base-heating situation.
Arranged in a cross-shaped configuration, the engine pattern of the
cluster was conceived to minimize dead air regions and turbulent
zones. The four inner engines were bunched together in the center to
reduce excessive heating in the central area, and the remaining four
were positioned to avoid structural interference as the gimbaled
engines swung on their mounts. The lower skirt was designed to direct
large streams of high-energy air toward the four center engines in
particular to prevent dead air regions from developing in their
vicinity. A heavy fire wall was installed across the base of the
booster near the throat of the engines, with flexible engine skirts
to permit gimbaling and, at the same time, keep the super-heated gas
from flowing back up to the turbopumps and propellant lines above.
The problem of the exhaust from the turbopumps received special
attention. For the four center engines, which were fixed, the
fuel-rich exhaust gases were piped to the edge of the booster skirt
and dumped overboard into a region of high-velocity air flow. In
later vehicles, the exhaust gases were dumped exactly into the
"centerstar" created by the four fixed engines. The gimbaled outboard
engines required a different approach. The turbopump was fixed to the
gimbaled engines; therefore an overboard duct for them would have
required a flexible coupling that could withstand the high
temperatures of the turbine exhaust gases. Instead, MSFC devised
outboard engine attachments called aspirators, which forced the
turbine exhaust into hoods around the engine exhaust area and mixed
the turbopump exhaust with the engine's main exhaust
flow.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.41">41</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Successful ignition and operation of an
eight-engine cluster of Saturn's dimensions required extensive
testing beforehand. In December 1958, ARPA released funds for
modifications to one side of a two-position Juno test tower in order
to test-fire the Saturn I first stage. Preparations for these static
tests, as they were called, required extensive reworking of the
Saturn's side of the tower, including a new steel and concrete
foundation down to bedrock, a steel overhead support structure and a
110-metric ton overhead crane, a new flame deflector and fire-control
system, and much new instrumentation. The job took a whole year. By
January 1959, ABMA crews installed a full-sized, high-fidelity
[<a name="80"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">80</font></b><font face="Geneva">] mockup of the first stage in the tower to check all
the interfaces for service and test equipment. Satisfied, they took
the mockup out, and put in the first static-test version. The test
booster, SA-T, was installed during February, and late in March the
first firing test, a timid one, burned only two engines for an
eight-second run. Many skeptics still doubted that the eight-engine
cluster would operate satisfactorily. "People at that time still had
a lot of difficulty persuading individual rocket motors to fire up...
reliably," von Braun explained, "and here we said we would fire up
all eight simultaneously." There were a lot of jokes about "Cluster's
Last Stand," von Braun chuckled. Still, the firing crew at Marshall
proceeded cautiously. Not until the third run, on 29 April 1960, did
test engineers fire up all eight barrels, and then only for an
eight-second burst. By the middle of June, the first stage was
roaring at full power for more than two minutes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Reverberations of the Saturn tests were
quickly felt. The acoustical impact was quite evident in the
immediate area around the city of Huntsville, and the long-range
sound propagation occurred at distances up to 160 kilometers. The
result was a rash of accidental damage to windows and wall plaster,
followed by a rash of damage claims (sometimes filed by citizens on
days when no tests had been conducted). Aware that climatic
conditions caused very pronounced differences in noise levels and
long-range sound propagation, engineers began taking meteorological
soundings and installed a huge acoustical horn atop a tower in the
vicinity of the test area. No ordinary tooter, the horn was over 7.6
meters long and had a huge flared aperture over 4.6 meters high. Its
sonorous gawps, bounced off a network of sound recorders, gave
acoustical engineers a good idea whether it was safe to fire the big
rockets on overcast days.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.42">42</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">To make the most use of the expensive test
facilities, as soon as a booster completed its test-firing series and
was shipped off to Cape Canaveral for launch, the SA-T booster was
fastened back into place for further verification and testing of
Saturn systems. The complex test instrumentation was complemented by
the growing sophistication of automatic checkout systems used in the
Saturn I first stage. Early hardware was designed for manual
checkout. As more advanced electronics and computers became
available, significant portions of the procedure were designed for
automatic tests and checks. The scope of automatic test and checkout
evolved into a complex network that tied together diverse geographic
test and manufacturing locations. Later generations of Saturn
vehicles and individual components were electronically monitored,
literally, from the time of the first buildup on the shop floor until
the mission was finished in outer space.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Because manufacturing tests of individual
stages occurred separately at diverse locations, a specialized
facility was required to verify the [<a name="81"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">81</font></b><font face="Geneva">] physical interface
design, system integration, and system operation of the total
vehicle. During a flight, natural structural frequencies occurred-the
result of vibrations of moving parts, aerodynamic forces, and soon.
If the control-force input of gimbaling engines, for example,
reinforced the structure's natural frequency, the amplification of
such structural deflections could destroy the vehicle. So a dynamic
test stand, large enough to surround a complete two-stage Saturn I,
was begun at MSFC in the summer of 1960 and finished early in 1961.
The dynamic test facility was designed to test the vehicle either in
entirety or in separate flight configurations. Vibration loads could
be applied to the vehicle in pitch, yaw, roll, or longitudinal axis
to get data on resonance frequencies and bending modes. Saturn I
tests uncovered several problem areas that were then solved before
launch. Matching frequencies in the gimbal structure and hydraulic
system were uncovered and "decoupled." Static tests revealed
weaknesses in the heat-shield curtains around the engines, so the
flexible curtains were redesigned. Structural failure of the outer
liquid-oxygen tanks required a reworking of the propellant flow
system.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.43">43</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Historically, the style of ABMA operations
emphasized in-house fabrication and production, as Army arsenals had
traditionally done. As the scale of the Saturn program increased,
MSFC made the obvious and logical choice to turn over fabrication and
manufacture to private industry. At the same time, the center
retained an unusually strong in-house capability, to keep abreast of
the state of the art, undertake preliminary work on new prototype
hardware, and to make sure that the contractor did the job properly
(for management details, see </font><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch9.htm">chapter 9</a></font><font face="Geneva">). The do-it-yourself idea was most strongly reflected
in the development of the Saturn I first stage. Ten Saturn I vehicles
were built and launched; the first eight used S-I first stages
manufactured by MSFC, although the fifth flight vehicle carried a
contractor-built second stage (the Douglas S-IV). The last two Saturn
Is to be launched had both stages supplied by private industry.
Douglas supplied the S-IV upper stage, and the Chrysler Corporation's
Space Division supplied the S-I lower stage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Late in the summer of 1961, while the first
Saturn I was en route to Florida for launch, MSFC began plans to
select the private contractor to take over its S-I stage. The
manufacturing site at Michoud was announced on 7 September, and a
preliminary conference for prospective bidders occurred in New
Orleans on 26 September. The first Saturn I was launched successfully
one month later (27 October), and on 17 November, Chrysler was
selected from five candidates to produce the S-I first stage. The
final contract called for the manufacture, checkout, and test of 20
first-stage boosters. Chrysler participated in the renovation of
Michoud as it tooled up for production. In the meantime, the shops at
Marshall turned out the last seven S-I boosters, progressively
relinquishing the primary production responsibility. During December
1961, for example,..... </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">....MSFC manufactured its last 1.78-meter and
2.67-meter tanks, turning over this job to Chance-Vought, of Dallas,
which supplied both MSFC and Michoud as Chrysler took over the
booster production.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.44">44</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Chrysler, a major automotive manufacturer, was
no novice to the production of rockets, having worked with the von
Braun team since [<a name="83"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">83</font></b><font face="Geneva">] 1954 producing
Redstone rockets and their successor, the Jupiter. Chrysler easily
shifted from the Saturn I to the larger Saturn IB. In July 1962, when
NASA announced its intention to use the lunar orbit rendezvous, the
space agency also released details on the two other Saturn vehicles.
The three-stage Saturn V was planned for the lunar mission. A
corollary decision called for development of an interim vehicle, the
Saturn IB, to permit early testing of Apollo-Saturn hardware, such as
the manned command and service modules, and the manned lunar
excursion module in Earth orbit, as well as the S-IVB stage of the
Saturn V. This decision permitted such flight testing a year before
the Saturn V would be available. Chrysler's initial contract,
completed late in 1962, called for 13 first-stage Saturn IB boosters
and 8 Saturn I first-stage boosters.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.45">45</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In most respects, the new S-IB first-stage
booster retained the size and shape of its S-I predecessor. The upper
area was modified to take the larger-diameter and heavier S-IVB upper
stage, and the aerodynamic fins were redesigned for the longer and
heavier vehicle. The Saturn IB mounted its eight H-I engines in the
same cluster pattern as the Saturn I, although successive
improvements raised the total thrust of each engine to 890 000
newtons (200 000 pounds) and then to 912 000 newtons (205 000
pounds). The thrust increase raised the overall performance of the
Saturn IB; the performance was further enhanced by cutting some 9000
kilograms of weight from the stage cluster. A more compact fin design
accounted for part of the reduction, along with modifications to the
propellant tanks, spider beam, and other components and removal of
various tubes and brackets no longer required. Additional weight
savings accrued from changes in the instrument unit and S-IVB, and
the insights gained from the operational flights of Saturn I. Many
times, engineers came to realize designs had been too
conservative-too heavy or unnecessarily redundant. The production
techniques worked out for the Saturn S-I stage were directly
applicable to the S-IB, so no major retooling or change in the
manufacturing sequence was required. With so few basic changes in the
booster configuration, existing checkout and test procedures could
also be applied. At Huntsville, appropriate modifications were made
to the dynamic test stand to account for the different payload
configurations of the Saturn IB and the same static test stand served
just as well for the S-IB first stage, although engineers reworked
the stand's second test position to accept additional S-IB
stages.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#3.46">46</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">....vehicle was discarded, the major issue
became Earth orbital rendezvous or lunar orbital rendezvous. One of
the last holdouts against LOR, Marshall eventually opted for it
because it averted the multiple launches of an EOR sequence and
offered the best chances for a successful mission before the end of
the 1960s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Once the issue of the mission profile had been
settled, the task of developing the resources for manufacturing and
testing of the Saturns became paramount, and engineers finalized the
design of the Saturn I's first stage, which evolved into the first
stage of the Saturn IB as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At this point, in the early 1960s, development
of the Saturn I and IB loomed large in press releases and news
stories, with special attention on [<a name="85"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">85</font></b><font face="Geneva">] the lower stages.
The work in this area set the baselines for manufacturing procedures,
static firing tests of the multibarrel cluster, and the first
launches of the Saturn I, with a live lower stage and a dummy upper
stage. Because NASA and MSFC planners put such special emphasis on
early static-firing tests of each stage, the engines had to be ready.
From the beginning, MSFC maintained a strong effort in research,
development, and production of Saturn propulsion systems. Meanwhile,
parallel work on other hardware of the Saturn program proceeded:
R&amp;D on the upper stages for the Saturn I and IB (to be modified
for the Saturn V); R&amp;D for the first two stages of the mammoth
Saturn V; plans for unique tooling required for production and
fabrication; schemes for guidance and control of the launch vehicle.
The main effort leading to large launch vehicles for manned lunar
voyages was just beginning to build momentum.</font></p>
