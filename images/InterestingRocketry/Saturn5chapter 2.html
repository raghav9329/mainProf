for Saturn envisioned a brawny booster to launch Department of
Defense payloads. The von Braun team at the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency (ABMA) received money from the Department of Defense's
Advanced Research Projects Agency to demonstrate the concept.
Furthermore, von Braun's group eventually became the nucleus of
NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). These convolutions and
the vague outlines of evolving Saturn vehicle technology constitute
the themes of </font><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch2.htm">chapter

<p><font face="Geneva">The Saturn program eventually included three
basic vehicles: Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V. </font><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch3.htm">Chapter 3</a></font><font face="Geneva"> describes the events that led to these three separate

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="25"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">25</font></b><font face="Geneva">] In November 1956,
when the Air Force finally triumphed over the Army and Navy for
leadership in long-range military rockets, planners at ABMA
momentarily regrouped to plot a new direction, a strategy for large
booster development geared instead to the exploration of space.
Having lost round one to the Air Force, ABMA's stratagem was to
leapfrog onward and upward to a quantum jump.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.1">1</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In April 1957, ABMA began design studies on an
advanced booster concept. With a total thrust of approximately 6 800
000 newtons (1.5 million pounds) in the first stage alone, the
proposed vehicle was referred to as the Super-Jupiter. The impetus
for the development of a Super-Jupiter class apparently evolved from
Department of Defense plans for "certain advanced missions using
space devices in communication," as well as space probes and weather
satellites. However, such payloads, especially satellite programs,
required a booster much larger than existing launch vehicles. The
Department of Defense guidelines called for a launch vehicle capable
of putting 9000 to 18 000 kilograms into Earth orbit or accelerating
space probes of 2700 to 5400 kilograms to escape velocity. At that
time, ABMA estimated that satellite carriers on order, such as Thor,
Juno II, and Atlas, could be expected to put up to 1400 kilograms
into orbit. This capability might be increased to 4500 kilograms with
high-energy propellants in upper stages. However, these boosters,
with conventional propellants, would not be available for at least
two years. The high-energy versions would not be operational until
1961 or 1962. Given the urgency of Department of Defense requirements
for large payloads, a new class of booster and associated equipment
had to be developed in a very short time, while keeping costs within
low DOD limitations.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.2">2</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">ARPA'S BIG BOOSTER</font></b>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="26"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">26</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Early design and
cost studies at ABMA suggested the possibility of using a single
engine of 4 450 000 newtons (1 million pounds) of thrust, for which
Rocketdyne Division of North American had made a feasibility study
for the Air Force. Although this was an "Air Force engine," no other
large propulsion system existed. The F-1 engine seemed unlikely to
reach the point of full-scale testing for at least two years-too late
to meet the accelerated booster development program of the Department
of Defense. In any case, a booster with 6 700 000 newtons (1.5
million pounds) of thrust was needed, so the ABMA planning staff gave
up on the simplicity of one large engine and turned to a combination
of four smaller ones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Rocketdyne also had a project under way for a
1 600 000- to 1 690 000-newton (360 000- to 380 000-pound) thrust
engine known as the E1. Proposals for the four-engine booster
involved the use of what one ABMA official called "off-the-shelf
tankage" (presumably a single large-diameter booster propellant tank
from the existing stable of military missiles) with the four E-1
engines in a clutter underneath it. This version of Super-Jupiter was
closely analyzed by ABMA and technical experts from North American,
and a number of upper-stage configurations were suggested. With
specific choices in terms of engines and tankage still open, ABMA was
by now certain that the clustering of engines was the most feasible
route to attain quickly the Department of Defense goal of a 6 700
000-newton (1.5-million-pound) first-stage booster. In December 1957,
ABMA delivered its proposal to the Department of Defense: "A National
Integrated Missile and Space Vehicle Development Program." The
document affirmed the clustered engine mode as a shortcut method to
achieve large payload capability in the least amount of
time.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.3">3</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Nevertheless, Super-Jupiter still remained a
feasibility study, existing only on paper and within the fertile
imaginations of von Braun and his group at Huntsville. The Department
of Defense had its stated requirements for payloads of many tons, and
ABMA had its proposals for possible booster configurations, but there
was still no priority or money to get Super-Jupiter past the level of
paperwork. The immediate catalyst came in the form of a new
Department of Defense organization whose high-priority
recommendations cut through layers of red tape and allocated dollars
for converting studies into hardware-the Advanced Research Projects
Agency (ARPA).</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During the turbulent months of late 1957 and
early 1958, the Eisenhower administration wrestled with the
challenges posed by Sputnik I, the abortive launches of Vanguard, and
the last ditch mission of Explorer I. A long-term, reasoned, and
integrated space program called [<a name="27"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">27</font></b><font face="Geneva">] for some informed
and firm decisions. In February, President Eisenhower chartered a
special committee under the guidance of Dr. J. R. Killian to study
the issues and make recommendations for a national space program. As
the Killian committee convened, the Department of Defense moved on
its own to rationalize space research involving the armed services.
On 7 February 1958, ARPA was formally established by Secretary of
Defense Neil H. McElroy, and after part-time guidance through most of
two months, Roy W. Johnson became the new agency's director on 1
April. Johnson, a graduate of the University of Michigan, had been
executive vice-president at General Electric. There was no doubt that
Johnson had extensive authority: he reported directly to the
Secretary of Defense. The influence of ARPA became evident when
William M. Holaday, Director of Guided Missiles in the Department of
Defense, received orders to transfer some of his activities to the
new agency. Johnson insisted on running ARPA as a mechanism for
establishing goals and coordinating research efforts, as opposed to
active R&amp;D work and management of contracts. ARPA made top
decisions and allocated the money, giving full rein to whatever
organization was nominated to run a project. ARPA remained a small,
tightly knit organization, numbering about 80 people "including the
girls (in the office)," as Johnson put it, and drew the core of its
technical staff from specialists in the Army, Navy, and Air
Force.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.4">4</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Through the spring of 1958, ARPA began to get
its own organization in line while ABMA continued preliminary studies
for the Super-Jupiter with E-1 engines. Then in July, ARPA began to
show more specific interest in the huge 6 700 000-newton
(1.5-million-pound) booster but argued for the use of available
engine hardware, as opposed to the still untried E-1 propulsion
systems. ARPA's line of reasoning was tied to its objective of
developing the big booster in the shortest amount of time and doing
the job within a framework of limited funds. The von Braun group in
Huntsville possessed considerable experience with the engines for its
own Jupiter series of rockets, and so a new cluster, with eight
Jupiter engines instead of four E-1 types, began to evolve. Even
though no formal agreements existed as yet between ARPA and ABMA, the
close working relationship between the two organizations was evident
in the name chosen for the new eight-engine booster. Known as Juno V,
the designation followed ABMA's prior conceptual studies for advanced
Juno III and Juno IV multistage rockets. By using off-the-shelf
hardware, including the engines, it was estimated that Juno V,
compared with the Super-Jupiter with E-1 engines, would save about
$60 millon and as much as two years research and development
time.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.5">5</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With such preliminaries out of the way, ARPA
issued more specific instructions to ABMA, granting authority and
authorizing funds for the Juno V. ARPA Order Number 14-59, dated 15
August 1958, clarified the discussions of the previous weeks:</font>
</p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="28"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">28</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Initiate a
development program to provide a large space vehicle booster of
approximately 1 500 000-lb. [6 700 000-newton] thrust based on a
cluster of available rocket engines. The immediate goal of this
program is to demonstrate a full-scale captive dynamic firing by the
end of CY 1959.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Geneva">This was an historic document, for it
committed money and engaged the von Braun team at Huntsville in an
effort they had long dreamed about. Juno V became the progenitor of a
new family of launch vehicles that would be used in the nation's
future space program. As von Braun himself put it, "Juno V was, in
fact, an infant Saturn.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.6">6</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Indeed, during this early period the Saturn
designation was frequently used by von Braun and others inside ABMA.
A new name seemed appropriate, because Saturn was seen as a distinct
break from the Juno series-a new breed of launch vehicle that would
see an active lifetime of a decade or more. "The SATURN," observed
one ABMA report, "is considered to be the first real space vehicle as
the Douglas DC-3 was the first real airliner and durable work-horse
in aeronautics."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.7">7</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> In the autumn of 1958, however, the full development
of the Saturn was only beginning. As two engineers from Huntsville
commented, "The state of the art at this time classified the Saturn
booster as almost impossibly complex."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.8">8</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="29"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">29</font></b><font face="Geneva">] The decision not to
use the E-1 engine and to go to off-the-shelf hardware did not catch
ABMA personnel flatfooted. Technicians and engineers at Huntsville
were already working on propulsion systems related to the Jupiter to
increase thrust, simplify operation, and improve overall mechanical
and other systems. This work gave the engine development an important
momentum early in the game and encouraged ABMA's optimism when ARPA
requested a program for static firing a multiple engine cluster
within 18 months, while operating on a shoestring budget. Still, "it
was not easy," Willy Mrazek, one of the top ABMA planners, mused
years later. One of the problems involved the engine manufacturer.
When ABMA contacted Rocketdyne and laid out the program, company
officials were intrigued by the big cluster idea but protested that
the dollar allocation simply could not stretch far enough to finance
the rebuilding and testing of engines and spares for the size of the
program suggested by ABMA. By using all their persuasive power, and
even a little "arm twisting," as Mrazek recalled, the von Braun group
convinced Rocketdyne to take the plunge, including the authorization
for the company to glean hardware from their stockrooms that was left
over from prior manufacturing and development programs sponsored by
the government. By 11 September 1958, Rocketdyne had signed a
contract with ABMA to uprate the original Thor-Jupiter engine, known
as the S-3D propulsion system, creating a unit suitably modified to
operate in the cluster configuration. The new engine was called the
H-1, and ABMA signed away half of its available funds to get
it.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.9">9</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With the money they had left, ABMA went to
work in Huntsville to decide how to allocate their scarce dollars for
oversized test stands and to define the configuration of the tankage.
An early decision was made to modify an existing test stand "out in
our backyard," as Mrazek phrased it, keeping in mind that, although
it had been designed to take Army missiles like the Jupiter
2.67-meter-diameter tank and a thrust of 734 000 newtons (165 000
pounds) the test stand had to be reworked to take a "monster" that
was 24 meters high, 6 meters in diameter, and built to put out a
thrust of almost 6 700 000 newtons (1.5 million pounds). The lean
budget also had to cover a miscellany of items such as tooling to
fabricate the oversized tanks and development of a thrust structure
to take the maximum force of eight engines firing together at full
throttle. There was also the need for oversized assembly jigs for
manufacturing and checkout of the big new booster and for the costs
of getting all the materials and the manpower to put the thing
together. Like Rocketdyne, ABMA found that short funds made a virtue
of scrounging in the dark corners of warehouses and stockrooms and
puts a premium on imaginative shortcuts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Because ARPA Order Number 14-59 called only
for a static demonstration in the test stand, not a flight-configured
launch vehicle, the booster that began to take shape on the Redstone
Arsenal drawing [<a name="30"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">30</font></b><font face="Geneva">] boards and in the
shops was definitely a bargain-basement and patchwork affair. The
volume of the tankage posed a special problem. The fabrication and
welding of a single 6-meter-diameter tank, with separate compartments
for fuel and oxidizer, meant new techniques and working jigs.
Consumption of time and money threatened to become exorbitant. A
different approach to the problem evolved, and existing tanks were
used instead. From its own earlier production runs, ABMA located
partial rejects and incomplete 1.78-meter tanks from the Redstone and
2.67-meter tanks from the Jupiter missiles. Since the engines were
going to be clustered, why not the tanks? "The dire need made us more
inventive," Mrazek pointed out, "and we bundled the containers to be
loaded with propellants." So the vaunted big booster emerged from the
drawing boards as a weird compromise of eight separate 1.78-meter
Redstone tanks surrounding a 2.67-meter Jupiter tank. It did not look
exactly like a smooth, streamlined futuristic vehicle for the
exploration of space, nor was it intended to be. Designed solely to
see if a blockbuster of a rocket could run its eight engines in
concert, ABMA was satisfied with its awkward-looking
compromise.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.10">10</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">While the work in Huntsville progressed,
representatives from ARPA kept a close watch on the proceedings and
made frequent visits to Redstone Arsenal. They increasingly liked
what they saw. So much so, in fact, that they decided to propose a
series of test flights. On 23 September 1958, ARPA and the Army
Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) drew up an additional memorandum of
agreement enlarging the scope of .....</font></p>

program. Signed by Major General J.B. Medaris for AOMC and Roy
Johnson for ARPA, the joint memorandum stated: "In addition to the
captive dynamic firing..., it is hereby agreed that this program
should now be extended to provide for a propulsion flight test of
this booster by approximately September 1960." Further, the von Braun
group was called on to produce three additional boosters, the last
two of which would be "capable of placing limited payloads in orbit."
Along with the new scheme came much needed funds. ABMA could now
count on $13.4 million in FY 1959 and $20.3 million in FY 1960 for
the captive firing test and first launch, in addition to $8.6 million
in the same period for development of appropriate facilities. For the
three additional flights by 1961, ABMA would receive as much as $25
million to $30 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The decision to make the Juno V into a flight
vehicle added new dimensions to planning problems. First, a launch
site had to be selected. Moreover, the size of the booster posed
unique transportation problems. As long as the launch location
remained undetermined (possibly a remote site in the Pacific), ABMA
planned to dismantle the entire booster and airlift the components
separately, a concept that would be possible because of the use of
individual propellant tanks, engines, and associated structural
modules. Still, the Juno V engineering team was never quite sure the
dismantling and rebuilding scheme would work effectively. "Thank
goodness," Mrazek admitted, "we never had to disassemble the first
flight vehicle." In the end, it was agreed to launch from the
Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, and ABMA worked out a more
feasible method of transporting its launch vehicles intact by relying
on water routes.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.11">11</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">While ARPA proceeded to hammer out a program
for booster development, a number of government committees were at
work, attempting to clarify overall priorities for a national space
program. On the heels of Sputnik, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson began
probing the status of America's national security and the space
program through hearings of the Senate Preparedness Investigation
Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Forces Committee. As chairman of the
subcommittee, Johnson kicked off the hearings on 25 November 1957.
The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was gearing up
its own studies about the same time, and the White House also had a
high-powered study in progress-the Killian committee, directed by
President Eisenhower's recently appointed Special Assistant for
Science and Technology, James R. Killian. The subcommittees of
Killian's group reporting early in 1958 evidently had the most
influence in shaping the Administration's approach. Even though the
committee reports were shot through with overtones of
[<a name="32"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">32</font></b><font face="Geneva">] national security and the notion of a space race with
the Russians, Administration officials generally agreed that
proposals for a new space agency should result in an organization
that was essentially nonmilitary. Because of its civil heritage,
existing programs, and general programs, NACA was singled out as the
most likely candidate to form the nucleus, though a new name was
recommended. Strictly military programs would continue under the
Department of Defense.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.12">12</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During April 1958, Eisenhower delivered the
formal executive message about the national space program to Congress
and submitted the Administration's bill to create what was then
called the "National Aeronautical and Space Agency." The hearings and
committee work that followed inevitably entailed revisions and
rewording, but the idea of a civilian space agency persisted, and the
old NACA role of research alone began to change to a new context of
large-scale development, management, and operations. Congress passed
the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 on 16 July, and
Eisenhower signed the bill into law on the 29th. During August, the
Senate speedily confirmed Eisenhower's nominations of T. Keith
Glennan as Administrator and Hugh Dryden as Deputy Administrator. At
the time of his appointment, Glennan was president of Case Institute
of Technology and had been a member of the Atomic Energy Commission.
Dryden, a career civil servant, had been Director of NACA but was
passed over as the new chief of NASA. The subsequent days and months
included some jockeying and horse trading to establish the principal
directives of the new organization.</font></p>

specifically designated NASA as the agency to conduct manned space
flight programs. In September, NASA's new Administrator, T. Keith
Glennan, and Roy Johnson of ARPA agreed to cooperate in the
development of a manned satellite. NASA's effective date of birth was
l October 1958. The employees who left their NACA offices Tuesday
evening, 30 September, returned to the same offices Wednesday morning
as personnel of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
With the passage of time, ARPA's entire big-booster program would
find a niche in the new organization.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.13">13</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> These were bold plans, and neither the old NACA nor
the new NASA possessed an existing capability for the job. Glennan
wanted ABMA's von Braun team for its abilities in launch vehicles and
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a major Army contractor) for its
general expertise in astronautical engineering and payload
development. NASA had to accept a compromise: the space agency got
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (officially transferred on 3 December
1958), but ABMA's missile team stayed in the Army. ABMA and its big
booster were, however, already enmeshed in NASA planning, and it was
only a matter of time before assimilation was
complete.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.14">14</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">NACA, for its part, had already been
speculating about its role in the space program, and several
committees had been at work in late 1957 and early 1958 studying the
various factors a space program entailed: vehicles; reentry; range,
launch, and tracking; instrumentation; space surveillance; human
factors; and training. Late in March 1958, a NACA group studying
"Suggestions for a Space Program" included notations for a launch
program in January 1959 to put satellites of 135 000 to 225 000
kilograms in orbit (reflecting the earlier Department of Defense
plans), and development of a rocket of 4 450 000 newtons (1 million
pounds) thrust, as well as "development of hydrogen fluorine and
other special rockets for second and third stages."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The ABMA large booster program first entered
NASA planning through the NACA Special Committee on Space Technology
chaired by Guyford Stever. The Working Group on Vehicular Program
included von Braun as chairman. Organized 12 January 1958, the Stever
committee made its final report on 28 October, when NASA was already
a month old.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.15">15</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Von Braun's working group on vehicles had already made
its preliminary report on 18 July. The language did not differ much
from that of the final draft. The report began with harsh criticism
of duplication of effort and lack of coordination among various
organizations working on the nation's space programs. "The record
shows emphatically," the report said, that the Soviet Union was
definitely ahead of the United States in space travel and space
warfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">How was the United States to catch up? There
were several existing vehicle systems to help the United States
proceed on a logical and consistent space research program. At least
two large booster types under [<a name="34"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">34</font></b><font face="Geneva">] development or in
the planning stages would place the Americans in a better position.
The von Braun paper described five generations of boosters. First was
the Vanguard class of launch vehicles, and second were the Juno and
Thor IRBM vehicles. Third were the Titan and Atlas boosters from the
ICBM inventory. Fourth came the clustered boosters, which would yield
up to 6 700 000 newtons (1.5 million pounds) of thrust. Fifth, and
last, was the possibility of using an advanced 6 700 000-newton
(1.5-million-pound) thrust single-barrel engine in a cluster of two
to four engines to give up to 25 000 000 newtons (6 million pounds)
of thrust. How were they to be employed? The working group
conjectured that the United States might put into operation a
four-man space station in 1961 with the use of the ICBM boosters. By
using clustered boosters, with first flights beginning in 1961, the
committee estimated a manned lunar landing in 1965-1966. The
clustered vehicles would also support the deployment of a 50-man
space station in 1967, and the fifth generation of boosters would
support sizable moon exploration expeditions in 1972, set up a
permanent moon base in 1973-1974, and launch manned interplanetary
trips in 1977. "The milestones listed... are considered feasible and
obtainable as indicated by the supporting information presented in
the body of the report," the working group
concluded.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.16">16</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The recommendations to achieve these goals
included NASA's rapid development as the major director and
coordinator of the vehicle program, working in partnership with ARPA.
"The immediate initiation of a development program for a large
booster, in the 1.5 million pound [6 700 000 newton] thrust class, is
considered a key to the success of the proposed program," the report
stated, and urged the development of such an engine. The program
would cost about $17.21 billion to pay for 1823 launches, including
the as-yet undeveloped ICBM and clustered boosters. There would be
considerable savings, the group noted, if a comprehensive booster
recovery scheme were incorporated.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.17">17</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With von Braun representing ABMA on the Stever
committee, his presence marked an early meshing of ABMA and NACA in
the nation's space programs. Indeed, the Stever committee was
intended to fill in the gaps in NACA space technology. NACA officials
James Doolittle, Dryden, and Stever selected committee members with
an eye to their future roles in the space programs as well as
educating NACA personnel in space R&amp;D. Large rocket boosters
certainly constituted a big gap in NACA competence, so that the
selection of von Braun was a key move, along with Sam Hoffman of
Rocketdyne, Abe Hyatt of the Office of Naval Research, and Colonel
Norman Appold, representing Air Force General Bernard Schriever, who
spearheaded the development of big rockets in the Air
Force.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.18">18</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="35"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">35</font></b><font face="Geneva">] The interwoven
activities of a civilian space agency using a booster of military
origins left the issue of payloads somewhat uncertain. ABMA had been
operating its big booster program under the aegis of ARPA and
considered the Juno V primarily a military vehicle with an imprecise
potential for use in a civilian role. On 13 October 1958, ABMA listed
its customers in order of importance. First was ARPA, as the
Department of Defense representative of all military services, with
the Juno V as a general carrier vehicle for research and development
of "offensive and defensive space weapons." Certain specific tasks
were forecast for each of the military services, including navigation
satellites for the Navy; reconnaissance, communications, and
meteorological satellites for the Army and Air Force; support for Air
Force manned missions; and surface-to- surface supply for the Army at
distances up to 6400 kilometers. For NASA, the ABMA planners
considered the possibilities of the Juno V in support of satellites,
space probes, and space stations, as well as a test bed for a 6 700
000-newton (1.5-million-pound) thrust engine and other propulsion
systems. There was also conjecture about using the big clustered
booster for international programs sponsored by the United Nations
and for missions under contract to companies in the private
sector.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.19">19</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Because the mission plans were beginning to
place more and more emphasis on putting payloads in orbit, there was
an evident need for an upper stage to ensure orbital velocity of the
payload. During the latter months of 1958, engineers at ABMA had
already begun the search for a feasible upper stage for the Juno V,
although the amended ARPA order in September called for lower flight
stages only. Medaris urged upper-stage studies because he liked the
idea of a unified and cohesive design effort; applying the
"off-the-shelf" dictum, he sought to identify possible upper-stage
candidates from projects already under way. One suggestion resulting
from such brainstorming was to mount an X-15 research plane atop the
Juno V, or perhaps incorporate an Air Force project known as
Dyna-Soar. The X-15 idea did not last long, but Dyna-Soar persisted
for several years. The Dyna-Soar (for dynamic soaring) dated from the
autumn of 1957 and was envisioned as a manned, rocket-propelled
glider in a delta-winged configuration, capable of reaching altitudes
of up to 120 kilometers. More likely prospects for Juno V upper
stages included Jupiter, Atlas, and Titan.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.20">20</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The problems of selecting the Juno V
configuration, upper stages, and payloads also bothered the people at
NASA. Sitting in his office on the second day of the new year 1959,
W. L. Hjornevik, Assistant to the Administrator, dashed off a memo to
his boss, Glennan. Hjornevik's [<a name="36"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">36</font></b><font face="Geneva">] message addressed
itself to a basic issue in NASA's future: "Next Steps in the
Development of a National Booster Program." The overtones in the memo
suggested the uncertainties that still faced the young organization,
not only in crystallizing specific goals but also in developing the
capabilities for the tasks ahead. In spite of conversations with
Dryden and others at NASA, Hjornevik wrote, he was still not sure of
the proper route to take in developing a rational booster program.
The payloads were still unsettled, and there was the problem of
timing to bring boosters on line while the payload issue was still
open. The question of a conventionally fueled second stage remained
unanswered, even while "our position on the million-pound cluster"
was unresolved.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.21">21</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During 1959, NASA began to cope with these
issues. A plethora of committees, long meetings, and voluminous
reports provided the milieu in which NASA and Department of Defense
personnel came to agreement on booster priorities, upper stages, and
the issue of high-energy propellants. In the process of settling
these problems, NASA acquired its own in-house capability for the
production of the nation's first large launch vehicles, to be known
as the Saturn rockets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In a report prepared for President Eisenhower,
dated 27 January 1959, NASA officially structured its own plan for a
national space vehicle program. Attributed to NASA's propulsion
staff, the document was prepared under the aegis of Abraham Hyatt,
Chief of Launch Vehicles. The principal author was a NASA engineer,
Milton Rosen. Preparation of the report included liaison with the
Department of Defense, especially ARPA, the Air Force, and the Army
to avoid duplication of effort and keep the Department of Defense
informed of NASA's intentions regarding the use of military hardware.
In its preamble, Rosen's report emphasized the lag in American rocket
technology vis-a-vis the Russians and underscored the need for a new
generation of large boosters. "The current group of booster vehicles,
namely Vanguard, Jupiter C, Juno II, and Thor-Able, were all
hurriedly assembled under pressure of meeting the threat of Russian
Sputniks," the document declared, "and none of them possesses the
design characteristics required by future needs of the National Space
Program." A successful space program, in NASA's view, required three
new classes of general-purpose launch vehicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The first type included two versions based on
the Atlas, one as a single-stage booster, and the other as a
two-stage booster using the liquid-hydrogen-fueled Centaur as the
second stage. The Centaur proposal had special significance, because
liquid hydrogen (LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">) technology was
recommended for inclusion in later designs. In fact, if high-energy
liquid hydrogen fuel failed to become an operable technology, then
the Rosen report predicated disappointingly low payloads in the
future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The second group of boosters was keyed to the
Juno V, the ABMA eight-engine cluster concept. NASA envisioned the
Juno V as the first stage of a large multistage vehicle, requiring
second and third stages to [<a name="37"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">37</font></b><font face="Geneva">] make a complete
booster, and the report proposed two different configurations. For
the version known as Juno V-A, the NASA propulsion staff recommended
adding the Titan I ICBM, itself a two-stage missile with conventional
fuel, making a three-stage vehicle. For Juno V-B, the third (top)
stage would be replaced with an LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">-fueled vehicle,
probably the Centaur, to achieve higher escape velocities. Missions
for the two Juno V variations included orbital research payloads, a
five-man orbiting module, and unmanned lunar and other planetary
missions using a fourth stage to gain escape velocity for larger
payloads. The report further estimated that the Juno V configurations
would be operational in 1963, with a useful lifetime of 5 to 10
years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">One of the most interesting items in the Rosen
report pertained to a completely new class of launch vehicle-a super
rocket of extraordinary size and payload capability known as Nova.
Propulsion for the Nova class of vehicles would rely on the 6 700
000-newton (1.5-million-pound) thrust single-chamber engine that had
been under development by the Air Force. With four engines clustered
in the first stage, Nova would generate an unprecedented 25 000 000
newtons (6 million pounds) of thrust at liftoff. The second stage
would use one of the same engines, and the third and fourth stages
would incorporate liquid- hydrogen-fueled engines (developed in the
Juno V program), with four of them in the third stage and one in the
fourth stage. The amount of propellants needed for such a
high-powered vehicle meant unusually large propellant tanks and a
rocket that towered to a height of 79 meters. NASA, however, would
also have a vehicle capable of fulfilling the dream of a manned lunar
landing. "Despite its immense size," the Rosen report argued, "Nova
is the first vehicle of the series that could attempt the mission of
transporting a man to the surface of the moon and returning him
safely to the earth."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.22">22</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During the course of the year, NASA's
attention was directed primarily toward Juno V and Nova, although
some name changes occurred. In February, the Department of Defense
announced that the Juno V development program would henceforth be
known as Project Saturn, with work to be continued at Huntsville
under the direction of ABMA. The change in big booster nomenclature
was consistent with von Braun's earlier inclination to refer to the
clustered rocket as Saturn and logically followed the Jupiter vehicle
in terms of christening boosters after successive planets in the
solar system. The Saturn also reflected a proclivity within ABMA to
name some boosters after ancient gods,</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.23">23</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> such as Juno and Jupiter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Meanwhile, the von Braun team at Redstone
Arsenal was becoming thoroughly enmeshed with the problem of
selecting Saturn's upper stages. A "Saturn System Study," completed
and submitted to ARPA on 13 March, contemplated the use of either
Atlas or Titan upper stages. But dozens of potential upper-stage
configurations were possible. This....</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">.....made NASA a bit anxious because realistic
planning was difficult as long as no firm booster configuration was
drawn up. T. Keith Glennan expressed his concern in a memo to Roy
Johnson at ARPA within a week of the publication of the "Saturn
System Study." An early decision on Saturn upper stages was needed,
he said, and he urged Johnson toward an early resolution of the
issue.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.24">24</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">ARPA's own plans for the Saturn booster
remained tied to a combination with Centaur, to place "very heavy
satellites in high orbits, especially for communications purposes."
In testimony before Congress in late March, Johnson described the
ARPA program for such satellites in equatorial orbits for global
communications. More than that, he emphasized development of the
Saturn cluster as a number one priority because it would serve a
number of vehicle requirements for the next two years, not only for
communications but also as an all-purpose space "truck" for a variety
of missions, including launches of manned orbital
satellites.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.25">25</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE ABMA TRANSFER</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The all-purpose Saturn suddenly ran into stiff
opposition within the Department of Defense. Herbert York, Director
of Department of Defense Research and Engineering, announced that he
had decided to [<a name="39"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">39</font></b><font face="Geneva">] terminate the Saturn
program. In a memorandum to Johnson dated 9 June 1959, York rebuffed
an ARPA request for additional funds. "In the Saturn case," York
said, "I consider that there are other more urgent cases requiring
support from the limited amount... which remains uncommitted." York's
reasoning apparently stemmed from a position taken by other
Eisenhower Administration advisors that the requirements of the
Department of Defense for launching military communications
satellites would be achieved more effectively by relying on existing
ICBM boosters. Saturn had always been touted as the military's
booster for such missions, so it did not seem to be needed any more.
Saturn was a "costly operation being conducted at ABMA," York wrote,
and advised Johnson, "I have decided to cancel the Saturn program on
the grounds there is no military justification."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.26">26</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> York's bombshell came as a real blow to ABMA,
especially since the first H-1 engines for the Saturn cluster had
begun arriving in Huntsville some weeks before, in
April.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.27">27</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With NASA programs tied closely to the Saturn,
as indicated in the earlier Rosen report, the launch vehicle staff in
Washington immediately got to work to head off the York cancellation
order as soon as they heard the news. Collaborating with Saturn
supporters from within the Department of Defense, Rosen and Richard
Canright from ARPA drafted a crucial memorandum in defense of the
clustered booster program. They realized that Saturn as an Army
project was in trouble apparently because the Army had no specific
use for it. At that time, neither did NASA, although Rosen and
Canright felt that the range of potential missions cited in the prior
Rosen report offered, in the long run, enough justification to keep
Saturn alive. Rosen and others in NASA were completely captivated by
Saturn's promise. "We all had gut feelings that we had to have a good
rocket," he said, emphasizing the appeal of Saturn's size. Rosen felt
that he had "lived all his life with too small a launch
vehicle."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.28">28</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Thus, in a tense three-day meeting, 16-18
September 1959, York and Dryden co-chaired a special committee to
review Saturn's future and discuss the roles of the Titan C boosters
and the Nova. Committee members included representatives from the
Army, Air Force, and NASA as well as Canright from ARPA. After hours
of intensive presentations and discussion, the Saturn backers finally
carried the debate, but not without some conditions. Under York's
prodding, it was agreed to start discussions to transfer ABMA and the
Saturn project to NASA. York also insisted that such a transfer could
be accomplished only with the Administration's guarantee for
supplemental funding in support of Saturn.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.29">29</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Years later, reviewing the issue of Saturn's
cancellation, York elaborated on his reasoning. For one thing, there
seemed to be a strong feeling within the Department of Defense that
Saturn tended to siphon off money, not only from important military
projects in ABMA but from [<a name="40"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">40</font></b><font face="Geneva">] the Air Force as
well. The Secretary of Defense twice turned down requests for a DX
(priority) rating for Saturn, once in December 1958 and again in May
1959. Moreover, York felt that Saturn was simply too big for any
military mission, and that included men in space. Big boosters of the
Saturn class should be NASA's responsibility, he reasoned, because
there was no urgent military application and because of York's own
reading of the Space Act of 1958 and his understanding of
Eisenhower's views on the matter. In the meantime, York apparently
agreed to continue adequate funding of Saturn through ARPA until the
issue of ABMA's transfer to NASA was resolved. As for the von Braun
team at Hunstville, York recalled that von Braun himself "made it
very clear in a face-to-face discussion in the Pentagon that he would
go along only if I allowed Saturn to continue."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.30">30</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The near loss of the Saturn booster was a
sobering experience. This close brush with disaster underscored
NASA's problems in securing boosters developed and produced by other
agencies; many in NASA now believed they had to have control of their
own launch vehicles. In fact, York had already favored the transfer
of ABMA, with responsibility for Saturn, to NASA. Late in 1958, when
Glennan and Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald A. Quarles had
proposed such a transfer, the Army and ARPA had strongly opposed the
move.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.31">31</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The ABMA transfer continued to beguile top NASA
executives, and Hjornevik emphatically urged action on the matter. In
a memo to Glennan late in January 1959, Hjornevik argued that the
role of ABMA as consultant and supplier was operable as long as NASA
was content merely to buy Redstone rockets in the Mercury program,
but the rapid changes in an ambitious NASA launch program revealed a
gap in the agency's capabilities, and Hjornevik left no doubt that
NASA needed ABMA's competence. Hjornevik phrased his recommendations
in no uncertain terms. "I for one believe we should move in on ABMA
in the strongest possible way," he declared. "It is becoming
increasingly clear that we will soon desperately need this or an
equivalent competence." Hjornevik cited NASA's needs in managing the
national booster program, especially the engines and "the big
cluster," and the suggested joint funding as a means to "achieve a
beachhead on the big cluster."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.32">32</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Roy Johnson, speaking for ARPA, emphasized the
need for keeping the von Braun team together, particularly if a
transfer occurred. "At Huntsville we have one of the most capable
groups of space technicians in the country," Johnson said during
congressional testimony in March 1959. "I think that it is a unique
group... a national resource of tremendous importance." Then he
added, "ABMA team is the kind of group that, if somebody had planned
10 years ago to create it, could not have been done better." Although
Johnson told the congressional committee that he could work with ABMA
in or out of the Department of Defense, he personally preferred it in
the Department of Defense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="41"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">41</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Among other things,
he commented, he was not optimistic about lunar payloads taking
precedence over the Saturn's role as a booster for military
satellites.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.33">33</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">NASA's lively interest in Saturn and the
Huntsville group continued to mount. In mid-April, Glennan called a
meeting of Dryden, Hyatt, Hjornevik, and others, including Abe
Silverstein, Director of Space Flight Development. The NASA
executives got together one Friday to assess the events of the past
week and, among other things, to consider the question of Saturn. In
the course of the discussion, the participants reached a consensus
that the highly competent ABMA group had the best qualifications to
develop the total Saturn vehicle, and they should be encouraged to
forge ahead. At the same time, NASA should keep a sharp eye on its
own interests in regard to Saturn and build a "significant financial
and management role." A distinct takeover move, previously pushed by
Hjornevik, did not take place for several months, simply because, as
Glennan himself observed, NASA lacked a specific mission for Saturn
that would justify wrenching the booster away from
ARPA.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.34">34</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">But the days of Saturn's ties to ARPA were
numbered. After letting the issue simmer on a back burner most of the
year, York raised the transfer issue again in the autumn of 1959, and
this time got the support of both the Secretary of Defense and
President Eisenhower.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.35">35</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Given the inclinations of the NASA hierarchy, ABMA's
transfer from ARPA became inevitable. NASA's own requirements for a
booster the size of the Saturn had been made more explicit as a
result of the Research Steering Committee on Manned Space Flight,
chaired by Harry J. Goett of NASA's Ames Research Center. The Goett
committee, formed in the spring, had considered NASA goals beyond the
Mercury program, and during the summer a circumlunar mission emerged
as the principal item in NASA's long-range planning. A manned lunar
landing required a much larger booster-Saturn. With potential mission
and booster requirements finally outlined, satisfying Glennan's
criteria to have a specific mission for the launch vehicle, total
NASA responsibility for Saturn was obviously
needed.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.36">36</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The transfer of ABMA, Saturn, and the von
Braun team was phased over a period of nearly six months. NASA's
technical direction of Saturn dated from a memorandum signed by
Glennan on 21 October 1959 and by the acting Secretary of Defense,
Thomas Gates, on 30 October, and approved by Eisenhower on 2
November. The document affirmed continuing joint efforts of NASA and
the Department of Defense in the development and utilization of ICBM
and IRBM missiles as space vehicles. Pointing out that there was "no
clear military requirement for super boosters," the memorandum stated
that "there is a definite need for super boosters for civilian space
exploration purposes, both manned and unmanned. Accordingly, it is
agreed that the responsibility for the super booster program should
be vested in NASA."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="42"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">42</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Specifically, the
core of ABMA's Development Operations Division would be shifted to
NASA-Saturn personnel, facilities, equipment, and funds. Both sides
agreed on the unique talent of the von Braun team and the need to
keep it intact. "The Department of Defense, the Department of the
Army, and NASA, recognizing the value of the nation's space program
of maintaining at a high level the present competence of ABMA, will
cooperate to preserve the continuity of the technical and
administrative leadership of the group."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.37">37</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The process of coordinating the
administrative, technical, and physical transfer of the Saturn
program progressed during the early months of 1960. To help provide
guidelines and avoid as much chaos as possible, NASA called on
McKinsey and Company, a private management consulting firm with
offices in several major U.S. cities, including Washington. McKinsey
and Company had helped NASA set up its own organization in 1958 and
was thereby familiar with the agency's headquarters structure and
personnel. By March 1960, the move was complete. On the 16th of the
month, NASA assumed both administrative and technical direction of
the Saturn program. The Goett committee, having wound up its work in
December 1959, had pointed NASA in the direction of lunar-oriented
missions as a goal. The transfer of the von Braun team, completed in
the spring of 1960, gave NASA the expertise and a vehicle program to
perform the task.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.38">38</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the process of shedding ABMA's initials,
the von Braun team now acquired a new set. By a presidential
executive order on 15 March 1960, the space complex within the
boundaries of Redstone Arsenal became the George C. Marshall Space
Flight Center (MSFC). On 1 July 1960, Major General August Schomburg,
commander of the Army Ordnance Missile Command, formally transferred
missions, personnel, and facilities to von Braun, as Director of
MSFC. Official dedication took place on 8 September with Mrs. George
C. Marshall and President Dwight D. Eisenhower heading the list of
distinguished visitors. In his public remarks, President Eisenhower
noted Marshall's military career, his distinguished service as the
Secretary of State, and the award to Marshall of the Nobel Peace
Prize, the only professional soldier to have received it. "He was a
man of war, yet a builder of peace," proclaimed Eisenhower. These
sentiments fittingly paralleled the evolution of MSFC, with its
origins in the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. In a brief, but moving
ceremony, Mrs. Marshall unveiled a red granite bust of her late
husband. Then von Braun escorted Eisenhower on a tour of the site,
including a close-up inspection of the Saturn booster under
construction.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.39">39</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During the months in which their relocation
was being debated, ABMA personnel in Huntsville were still absorbed
in the exercise of [<a name="43"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">43</font></b><font face="Geneva">] trying to determine
the configuration of upper stages for their multiengine booster.
Design drawings of Saturn B and Saturn C studies during the first few
months of 1959 showed clustered tank-and-engine first stages of 6.5
meters diameter and various combinations of upper stages of 6.5-meter
and 3-meter diameters towering as high as 76 meters. The use of new
hardware was apparently not contemplated; given ARPA's guidelines for
economy in the program, a more realistic possibility was to add upper
stages that used Titan or Atlas ICBM vehicles fitted directly to the
clustered tankage and engines. By the spring of 1959, both ABMA and
ARPA agreed on the feasibility of Titan and Atlas versions. ARPA
advisors leaned more toward a decidedly hybrid concept in which a
modified Titan second stage was used in combination with a modified
Centaur third stage from the Atlas vehicle. Yet another twist in the
evolution of Saturn upper stages came in July, when DOD's Director of
Research and Engineering issued a new directive to both the Air Force
and ARPA to consider the joint development of a second-stage vehicle
keyed to the Air Force Dyna-Soar project, since the Saturn second
stage and the Dyna-Soar booster appeared to be similar in design and
concept. So ARPA ordered work on the Titan upper-stage studies to
stop, pending further studies on this new DOD directive, although
R&amp;D work on the first-stage cluster forged ahead through the
summer.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.40">40</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The decision to halt work in mating existing
military missiles to the Saturn came as something of a relief to
ABMA. Using such off-the-shelf hardware definitely narrowed the
flexibility of mission planning. As a second-stage booster, it turned
out that Jupiter just did not have the muscle, and the Atlas and
Titan, although adequate in thrust for their ground-launch ICBM role,
lacked performance capabilities as upper-stage vehicles to be ignited
at altitude. Moreover, their 3-meter diameters limited their growth
potential in relation to the possibilities of the far bigger Saturn.
"In comparison," Willy Mrazek said, "this was like.... </font></p>

cancellation of work on the Titan as an upper stage, ARPA decided to
forego requirements to employ existing hardware, and ABMA confidently
embarked on a new series of design concepts for Saturn upper stages,
utilizing large diameters that offered increased mission flexibility
and payload capability. Undertaken in the fall of 1959, these new
"Saturn System Studies," as they were called, were conducted with an
eye to NASA requirements in particular.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.42">42</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The last months of 1959 could be called a
watershed period for NASA in many respects. The agency had acquired
the von Braun team and sharpened the focus on upper stages for a
multistage vehicle. In December, a critical judgment on the
application of high-energy propellants for Saturn's upper stages was
in debate. The issue of high-energy propellants centered on liquid
hydrogen in combination with liquid oxygen-and the use of liquid
hydrogen (LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">) did not have the wholehearted support of von Braun or
his staff at Huntsville.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">At NASA Headquarters, on the other hand, Abe
Silverstein and several others were convinced that
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
was the key to future Saturn success. Silverstein had joined NACA in
1929, and worked in wind tunnels at the Langley Laboratory. When the
Lewis Propulsion Laboratory was formed in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1943,
Silverstein joined the new organization and became its Associate
Director in 1952. He had come to Washington in 1958 to become
Director of Space Flight Development. For the next three years,
Silverstein played an important role in policy decisions at NASA
Headquarters before returning to Cleveland as Director of Lewis
Research Center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">NASA had inherited an LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> development program
as a result of NACA work carried on at Lewis Research Center
throughout the 1950s; the work culminated in the successful test of
an 89 000-newton (20 000-pound) thrust LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engine and
propellant injector in the late l950s. The Lewis LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> group, led by Abe
Silverstein, had been convinced of the practicality of
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
by subsequent successful test runs. The research at Lewis-and its
successful prototype engine design-encouraged Silverstein to push
hard for LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engines in Saturn's upper stages.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.43">43</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The first practical application of the
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
engine was planned as a high-energy stage, named Centaur, for Atlas
or Titan. The plan stemmed from an ARPA directive to the U.S. Air
Force's Air Research and Development Command. During congressional
testimony in March 1959, Roy Johnson noted early plans to incorporate
an LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">-fueled stage (apparently the Centaur, or a close
derivative) on the Saturn vehicle. Continuing research was solving
problems of pumping LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> in large quantities,
he explained, and he expected a breakthrough in propulsion for use in
a second or third stage. Johnson's enthusiasm for an
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
vehicle was unbounded. "It is a miracle stage as I see it," he
declared.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.44">44</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> By the summer of 1959, the LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> rocket

<p></p><center><b><font face="Geneva">THE SILVERSTEIN
COMMITTEE</font></b></center><p></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Just before the Christmas holidays, the stage
was set for a high-level conference at Headquarters to determine the
basic configuration of the multistage Saturn. On 17 November,
Associate Administrator Richard Horner told the Director of Space
Flight Development to organize a study group to make additional
recommendations concerning the transfer of the von Braun team to
NASA, "to prepare recommendations for guidance of the development of
Saturn, and specifically, for selection of upper-stage
configurations." A "Saturn Vehicle Team" was organized; it comprised
representatives from NASA, the Air Force, ARPA, ABMA, and the Office
of the Department of Defense Research and Engineering (ODDR&amp;E).
Chaired by Abe Silverstein, the seven-man group was known as the
"Silverstein Committee." In addition to Silverstein, the NASA
representatives included Hyatt and Eldon Hall, and the other members
were Colonel N. Appold (USAF), T. C. Muse (ODDR&amp;E), G. P. Sutton
(ARPA), and Wernher von Braun (ABMA).</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.46">46</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">When the Silverstein committee convened in
December, not everyone was in favor of the untried
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
technology because LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> was widely thought
to be too volatile and tricky to handle. Von Braun in particular
expressed doubts about LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> even though the
Saturn-Atlas combination had the Centaur's LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> system in the Atlas
final stage, and he was definitely opposed to a new
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
Saturn second stage. On the other hand, several influential committee
members made a forceful case for LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">. Hyatt was already
for it; Eldon Hall, not long before the committee had been organized,
had analyzed the performance of launch vehicles using various
combinations of propellants. Using his background in the work
previously done at Lewis, Silverstein argued with all the persuasive
powers at his command. It was just not logical, Silverstein
emphasized, to develop a series of vehicles over a 10-year period and
rely on the limited payload capability of conventionally fueled
boosters with liquid oxygen and kerosene-based propellants. He was
convinced that the use of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> in the upper Saturn
stages was inherently sound, and his conviction was the major factor
in swaying the whole committee, von Braun included, to accept
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
boosters in the Saturn program. "Abe was on solid ground," von Braun
acknowledged later, "when he succeeded in persuading his committee to
swallow its scruples about the risks of the new
fuel."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.47">47</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Next, von Braun had to convince his colleagues
back at Huntsville. Before the committee adjourned, von Braun
telephoned the Redstone Arsenal to talk to Mrazek, one of the key
team members who had come with him from Germany, and the two men
brainstormed the possibilities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As Mrazek recalled his phone conversation, von
Braun made the following points: The Saturn could not use existing
hardware for the upper stages-it needed an original design; the
Saturn plan should stress the new hydrogen technology and the
Centaur's engines; and the hydrogen upper stage would need six
engines. This final aspect could have been controversial because some
experts still harbored strong doubts about the use of eight
conventional, though proven, rocket engines for the first-stage
booster. There would be even more carping about a half dozen new and
untried engines burning exotic liquid hydrogen. But von Braun said he
was not overly concerned about the cluster of six hydrogen engines,
since at least a dozen Centaur launches were scheduled before the
first Saturn would have to go up. The ABMA group could profit from
whatever trials and tribulations the Centaur engines developed, with
plenty of time to iron out any problems before the first Saturn left
the launch pad. In short, von Braun was confident of success with the
new hydrogen technology, and Mrazek agreed; so the scenario was
finally set.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.48">48</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> (See </font><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch5.htm">chapter 5</a></font><font face="Geneva"> for further details of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> technology.)</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="47"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">47</font></b><font face="Geneva">] In the spring of
1960, as the word of NASA's decision to rely on the novel propellant
combination for Saturn reached the public, Eldon Hall and Francis
Schwenk, from the Office of Launch Vehicle Programs at NASA
Headquarters, outlined the reasons for the choice. The higher vehicle
performance required for advanced missions simply required higher
energy propellants, they explained. The staging of several rockets
using conventional propellants rapidly reached optimum design limits,
because advanced missions and payloads required more thrust and more
engines-which meant heavier rockets with bigger tanks and engines and
proportionately less efficiency in design and capability. On the
other hand, high-energy propellants promised the best results for
advanced missions requiring high escape velocities. "The choice of
high-energy upper stages for Saturn is based almost entirely on the
fact that, with present knowledge of stage construction, at least one
of the upper stages must use high-energy propellants if certain
desirable missions are to be accomplished with this vehicle," Hall
and Schwenk emphasized. So "the Saturn program was established for
early incorporation of a high-energy second stage into the vehicle
system."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.49">49</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In the course of the deliberations of the
Silverstein committee, three types of missions for the Saturn vehicle
emerged. First priority was given to lunar and deep-space missions
with an escape payload of about 4500 kilograms. Next in order of
priority came satellite payloads of about 2250 kilograms in a 24-hour
equatorial orbit. Finally, the committee considered the possibility
of manned missions involving the Dyna-Soar program, in which a
two-stage vehicle would be used to put 4500 kilograms into low orbit.
On the basis of these assumptions, the committee stressed the
evolutionary pattern of Saturn development and its potential for a
variety of future roles. "Early capability with an advanced vehicle
and possibilities for future growth were accepted as elements of
greatest importance in the Saturn vehicle development."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Once more, the Saturn Vehicle Team reviewed
the wide array of potential configurations, reduced the number of
choices to six, and began to weed out the least promising. The A-1
version, with modified Titan and Centaur upper stages, would provide
the earliest flight schedules and lowest costs with existing
hardware. It was rejected because it could not meet lunar and
satellite payload requirements and because the slender
3-meter-diameter upper stages were considered to have potential
structural weaknesses. The A-2 type, with a cluster of Intermediate
Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) in the second stage, also saved
money and promised early availability but did not have the capability
for some of the planned missions. A proposed B-1 vehicle met all
mission requirements but needed a totally new stage with conventional
fuels. The B-1 type was expensive, would take a lot of time to
develop, and had some shortcomings for advanced missions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="48"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">48</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Moreover, all first
three candidates needed high-energy propellants in the top stage. So
why restrict the promise of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> to the top stage
alone? "If these propellants are to be accepted for the difficult
top-stage applications," the committee concluded, "there seem to be
no valid engineering reasons for not accepting the use of high-energy
propellants for the less difficult application to intermediate
stages." The Saturn family of rockets finally envisioned by the
Silverstein committee included C-1, C-2, and C-3, all with
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
in the upper stages. The three-stage C-1 met the mission requirements
and used Centaur engines in the LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> upper stages. The
second stage had four uprated Centaur engines, designated the S-IV
stage, and the S-V top stage was the Centaur itself, with two
engines. The hop-scotch numbering occurred because of the "building
block" concept, in which hardware was used as available, the concept,
was tested, and then newer and advanced stages were incorporated in
the next major configuration. During C-1 development and flight, for
example, a new S-III stage for Saturn C-2 would be prepared with the
use of a newer, more powerful generation of LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engines. As the
development and flight test of Saturn C-2 proceeded, the S-II stage
would be worked up with four of the newer LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engines. The final
C-3 vehicle would stack all the various stages together as a
five-stage booster. Further, the Saturn Vehicle Team suggested that
the first stage of the C-3 model might even include an F-1 engine to
replace four of the cluster of eight uprated H-1 engines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">In its final recommendations for the phased
development of Saturn C-1 through C-3, the Silverstein committee
emphasized the building block concept keyed to the Saturn first-stage
cluster, along with hydrogen-oxygen propellants in all the upper
stages. Proceeding from the Centaur technology under development at
the time, the committee urged immediate development of a new
LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva">
engine and initiation of design studies for the S-II and S-III stages
to use the more powerful engines.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.50">50</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With in-house capability established, in the
form of the ABMA transfer, and with immediate vehicle guidelines
established as a result of the Silverstein committee, NASA now
proceeded to refine its priorities and goals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The ultimate goal was a lunar landing. The
Director of Lunar Vehicles, Donald R. Ostrander, stated in a planning
conference for NASA and industry in January 1960: "The principal
mission which we have used as an objective in these planning studies
has been that of a manned landing on the moon and return to

soon after. The agency also estimated the cost at $13 to $15 billion
over the coming decade, and Associate Administrator Horner explained
the need to look so far ahead and plan a budget:</font></p>

<blockquote><p><font face="Geneva">Virtually all of our key programs
presume a scheduled progress in launch vehicle and spacecraft
development. These major developmental tasks frequently require time
periods of 5 to 6 years for completion and can be substantially
longer under given circumstances of technological progress and
research availability.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Thus, although the usefulness of highly
tentative plans might be questioned, long-term objectives, on the
order of 10 years in advance of today's program, are essential to
keep our development activities properly focused.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The actions we initiate this year and next in
the vehicle development program will have a determining influence our
capabilities for meeting national objectives in the last half of this
decade and even beyond. Accordingly, we have developed a 10-year
plan, one which we expect to modify from year to year on the basis of
realized experience, development progress, and resource availability.
It is formulated around the requirement that its implementation must
so utilize the resources of the United States that our national role
as a leader in the aeronautical and space sciences and their
technologies is preserved and steadily enhanced. We have also assumed
that a steady growth in the scale and intensity of our efforts,
especially for the next 5 years, is an essential basis for consistent
and fruitful efforts in meeting this requirement.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.52">52</a></font></sup></b></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As NASA prepared to forge ahead on its 10-year
program in 1960, the agency enjoyed increased support from
Eisenhower, and Glennan won an important advantage for the Saturn
program in terms of a high priority endorsement. "As we have agreed,"
the President wrote to Glennan on 14 January, "it is essential to
push forward vigorously to increase our capability in high thrust
space vehicles." In the same directive to Glennan, Eisenhower gave
his authorization to prepare an additional funding request for the
balance of fiscal 1960 and 1961, "to accelerate the super booster
program," and to use overtime as needed, "consistent with my decision
to assign a high priority to the Saturn development." Four days
later, on 18 January, the rating for highest national priority (DX
rating) became official, authorizing the use of overtime wages and
giving Saturn precedence for materials and other program
requirements.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.53">53</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The configurations of the Saturn family were
still in a state of flux, however, and the Nova was still a
probability in the NASA scheme. Straightening out the lines of
development and mission application became an issue that absorbed
personnel in program studies and committee meetings for another two
and a half years. Although the Saturn Vehicle Team did not mention
Nova in their recommendations, the towering booster figured
prominently in plans for manned lunar landings. During a meeting on
advanced propulsion requirements at NASA Headquarters in early June
1960, the Huntsville group discussed Nova "for manned lunar landing
and return," in a configuration that
[<a name="51"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">51</font></b><font face="Geneva">] would boost a 81 600-kilogram payload to escape
velocity and return 6800 kilograms to Earth. The vehicle featured
eight of the 6 700 O00-newton (1.5-million-pound) thrust engines in
the first stage, four LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engines in the
second stage, and one LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engine each in the
third and fourth stages. Data for a C-2 launch with assisted boost
from Minuteman missile solid-fuel strap-ons were also discussed,
although "Marshall people were not enamored with the idea of any
changes to the C-2."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.54">54</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Therefore, the Saturn configurations remained keyed to
liquid propulsion engines, especially the LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> propulsion systems.
NASA planners considered using the Saturn "C" series of vehicles for
manned space stations, manned circumlunar missions, and unmanned
lunar and planetary probes. Manned lunar excursions, Homer Stewart
reminded NASA Administrator Glennan, would definitely require the
application of the 6 700 000-newton (1.5-million-pound) thrust engine
(known as the F-1) used in a cluster, probably in a Nova vehicle, and
if the LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> program developed any snags, he warned, the Saturn
program would quickly find itself in dire
trouble.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.55">55</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Toward the end of 1960, NASA planners decided
it was time to review the space program once again and make more
specific recommendations for future development in the Saturn and
Nova projects. Early in November, NASA laid out its milestone for the
next 10 years. "A ten-year interval has no special significance," the
report asserted, "yet it is considered to be an appropriate interval
since past experience has shown that the time required to translate
research knowledge into operationally effective systems in similar
new fields of technology is generally of this order." This time span
permitted opportunity to establish mission goals and plans and
coordinate the development of spacecraft and appropriate booster
hardware. Apparently there was already some confusion about
terminology, since the "Proposed Long Range Plan," as drafted by the
Headquarters Office of Program Planning &amp; Evaluation, included
some definitions. "Launching vehicle" meant a first-stage booster and
upper stages to inject a spacecraft into proper trajectory.
"Spacecraft" included the basic payload as well as guidance and its
own propulsion systems for trajectory modifications following
injection. The term "space vehicle" encompassed the entire
system-launching vehicle plus spacecraft.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.56">56</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">With definitions thus established, the
document discussed the major launch vehicles, or boosters, under NASA
cognizance: C-1, C-2, and Nova. The C-1 and C-2 descriptions closely
followed the analysis prepared by the Silverstein committee the
previous year, the descriptions reaffirming the building block
concept with the C-1 as a three-stage vehicle and the C-2 as a
four-stage booster including a newly developed second stage with a
cluster of four 890 000-newton (200 000-pound) thrust hydrogen
engines. The R&amp;D for the Centaur and the new hydrogen engines
appeared to be the biggest gamble in the long-range plan. The
decision to use LOX-LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> engines in C-1 and
C-2 upper stages "was based on a calculated risk," the report stated,
that such engine technology [<a name="52"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">52</font></b><font face="Geneva">] would come along
smoothly enough to keep the building block sequence on schedule. By
FY 1964-1967, according to the "Proposed Long Range Plan," the C-1
should be operational in support of preliminary Apollo orbital
missions, as well as planetary probes and as a test bed for advanced
technology electron engines and nuclear engines. The C-2 should be
ready somewhat later to place twice the payload into orbit, as well
as for launching deep-space probes.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.57">57</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As for the Nova, "its primary mission is to
accomplish manned lunar landings," the plan said. Nova was admittedly
still in the conceptual stage, since its size and ultimate
configuration depended on space environmental research, progress in
advanced chemical engines such as the F-1, and potential development
of nuclear engines. The Nova, with an F-1 cluster combination to
total 53 million newtons (12 million pounds) of thrust in the first
stage, seemed to be the most feasible, and the Nova booster could
make a manned lunar landing mission by direct staging to the moon and
return or by a series of launches to boost hardware into low orbit
for a series of rendezvous operations, building up a space vehicle in
low orbit for the final lunar mission.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.58">58</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">As a prelude to the ambitious moon missions, a
lot of basic research had to be integrated into the plans for the
launch vehicle development. Guidance and control was one area singled
out for special attention, requiring advances in the state of the art
in accelerometers; in cryogenic, electromagnetic, and electrostatic
support systems for gyros and attitude control; inertia wheels; in
long-life gyro spin axis bearings. The long-range plan noted research
challenges in terms of heating and other aerodynamic problems, along
with mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, electronic, and structural
difficulties. The space environment created a wide range of potential
trouble spots in metals, plastics, seals, and lubricants. The
scaled-up size of Saturn and Nova suggested difficulties in devising
adequate automatic test equipment and techniques for the fabrication
and assembly of oversized components. The long-range plan provided
the opportunity to look ahead and anticipate these problem areas,
giving NASA designers and engineers the chance to start working on
solutions to these and other problems that were sure to crop up in
the course of launch vehicle development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The long-range plan also estimated the
costs.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.59">59</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> NASA's plans at this time found support from the
President's Scientific Advisory Committee, which had formed a special
ad hoc group to examine the space program to date and analyze its
goals, missions, and costs. In its report, released on 14 November,
the group advanced the rationale that "at present the most impelling
reason for our effort has been the international political situation
which demands that we demonstrate our technological capabilities if
we are to maintain our position of leadership." The report considered
the scientific motive of much less significance than prestige but
commented that "it may be argued that much of the motivation and
drive for the scientific exploration of space is derived from the
dream of man's getting into space himself."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.60">60</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> The committee wondered if 25 test flights for the C-1
and 16 for the C-2 were enough to qualify the vehicles for manned
launches but gave NASA good marks overall on their plans and
schedules. Further, the committee endorsed the R&amp;D plans for
liquid hydrogen technology and encouraged development of larger
post-Saturn launch vehicles like the Nova.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.61">61</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">But NASA was not entirely free from
difficulties. NASA Administrator Glennan departed NASA at the end of
the Eisenhower Administration and resumed his position as president
of Case Institute. Several weeks passed before President John F.
Kennedy's new Administration settled on a successor. Lyndon Johnson,
the Vice-President, still played a strong hand in space program
planning, and favored someone with strong administrative credentials.
Other advisers contended that NASA needed a technical man at the
helm. As the Kennedy Administration prepared to take over early in
1961, the space agency received some hard knocks from the
President-elect's science advisor, Jerome B. Wiesner, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kennedy announced Wiesner's
appointment on 11 January and released the "Wiesner Report" the next
day.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.62">62</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Officially titled "Report to the President-Elect of
the Ad Hoc Committee on Space," the report gave due credit to the
"dedication and talent" that had achieved notable advances in space
exploration during the past few years but implied deficiencies in the
booster program. "Our scientific accomplishments to date are
impressive," the document observed, "but unfortunately, against the
background of Soviet accomplishments with large boosters, they have
not been impressive enough."</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Among other recommendations, the Wiesner
report urged technical competence in the positions of Administrator
and Deputy Administrator, along with technical directors for
propulsion and vehicles, scientific programs, nonmilitary space
applications, and aeronautical programs.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.63">63</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">For several weeks, contact with the new
Kennedy Administration was [<a name="54"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">54</font></b><font face="Geneva">] haphazard. The
Wiesner report aroused real concern among NASA personnel; there was a
definite feeling that the report was neither fair nor carefully
prepared. The issue of NASA leadership was resolved in February, when
James E. Webb was nominated as Administrator. Vice President Johnson
had found the managerial talent he wanted. A lawyer and ex-officer in
Marine Corps aviation, Webb had headed the Bureau of the Budget and
served as Undersecretary of State during the Truman Administration.
At the time of his appointment, Webb was actively involved in the
management of large corporations and was an active member of several
professional administrative and policy organizations. Webb was sworn
in by 14 February, with Dryden again as Deputy Administrator. Members
of the Wiesner committee were subsequently given a deeper insight
into the NASA program and organization that produced a much more
positive feeling on their part. The organizational structure of the
space agency was indeed firmed up, and a healthy rapport was
established with the new Administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During the 1960 campaign, Kennedy had made an
issue of the Eisenhower record in space, although the question was
addressed more in terms of the so-called "missile gap" than in terms
of space exploration. After the election, however, the Kennedy
Administration evinced a growing interest in NASA's programs. In
February, Webb was asked to conduct a thorough review and make
recommendations; although a revised NASA budget request was trimmed,
the space agency went to Congress in March with a program that
amounted to over $125 million more than Eisenhower's original $1.1
billion for fiscal 1962. On 10 April, Kennedy submitted a specific
request to amend the Space Act, in keeping with a campaign statement,
to revive the dormant National Aeronautics and Space Council, and to
appoint Vice-President Lyndon Johnson, a partisan of space
exploration, as its head. In sum, the national space program under
the new Kennedy Administration began moving with positive, if modest,
momentum. Rapid acceleration occurred as a reaction to dramatic
Russian progress.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.64">64</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">The successive achievements of Russian efforts
in space exploration early in 1961 not only intensified NASA's plans
in astronautics, but also influenced President Kennedy's commitment
to a more active program by the United States. The day after Webb and
Dryden were sworn in, the Soviet Union launched a probe to Venus from
a space vehicle in a parking orbit; Kennedy remarked at a public
press conference that the Russian lead in space boosters was "a
matter of great concern."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.65">65</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Then, on 12 April, while Congress was debating
additional funds for NASA's budget in the coming year, a Russian
booster put Yuri Gagarin into Earth orbit-the first human to orbit
the Earth. On the evening of the following day, President Kennedy
hosted a meeting at the White House, inviting Webb, Dryden, Wiesner,
Theodore Sorensen, and several others, including
[<a name="55"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">55</font></b><font face="Geneva">] a reporter, Hugh Sidey, from Life magazine. The
conversations revealed Kennedy's considerable concern about the
Soviet Union's growing preeminence in space. The President speculated
about the steps the United States could take to improve its own
activities and about the costs involved in an accelerated program.
Dryden observed that it might cost up to $40 billion to fund a
program to land on the moon before the Russians, and even then, the
Russians might make it before the Americans. But the President
clearly wanted action. "There's nothing more important," he was
remembered as saying.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.66">66</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Not long afterward, in remarks to the Congress,
Kennedy firmly asserted that it was "time for this nation to take a
clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may
hold the key to our future on Earth."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.67">67</a></font></sup></b><font face="Geneva"> Shortly thereafter, Kennedy instructed Johnson and the
Space Council to study space projects that would give the United
States a visible lead in space exploration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">Congress also wanted more information from
NASA about costs and the problems of landing on the moon ahead of the
Russians. In mid-April, Webb repeated to Congress what Dryden had
told the President. The cost would be anywhere from $20 to $40
billion. Some congressmen suggested the possibility that the Russians
might attempt a lunar landing around 1967, in conjunction with the
50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. With massive infusion of
funds, the representatives asked, could the Americans beat a Russian
landing? In his response, Associate Administrator Robert Seamans was
wary. The target date of 1967 for the Russians was only an
assumption, he said. Current NASA planning put an American lunar
landing in 1969 or 1970 at the earliest. To reduce American
intentions by three years was not necessarily an impossibility,
Seamans stated, but would certainly be tremendously expensive in the
short term.</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.68">68</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">During April and May, the executive and
legislative branches of government blossomed committees and working
groups like flowers in a spring garden. Within NASA, planning groups
funneled a series of honed and polished study papers to the White
House for Kennedy's consideration, and the Department of Defense and
the space agency refined mutual goals and individual efforts to
ensure cooperation where necessary and to avoid needless redundancy.
The nexus of all these streams of activity culminated in President
Kennedy's State of the Union message on 25 May 1961. The manned space
program would be the province of NASA, a civilian agency, not a
military agency. He proposed to increase NASA's 1962 budget by more
than $500 million. Kennedy left no doubt as to NASA's objective or
its schedule for realization. "This nation should commit itself to
achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on
the Moon, and returning him safely to the Earth."</font><b><sup><font face="Geneva"><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#2.69">69</a></font></sup></b></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva">[<a name="56"></a></font><b><font face="Geneva">56</font></b><font face="Geneva">] Haltingly, a
national space program coalesced around a new entity, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. After turning to the Department
of Defense for its large boosters, funded through ARPA and under
development by ABMA, NASA realized the need to control its own
booster program when the Saturn project was nearly canceled owing to
budgetary cross-currents. The eventual transfer of the von Braun team
and the Saturn booster was a significant step forward for NASA.
During 1959-1960, important agreements on upper stages and the use of
high-energy LH</font><sub><font face="Geneva">2</font></sub><font face="Geneva"> technology were also worked out, capped by President
Kennedy's decision to achieve a manned lunar landing within the
decade of the 1960s. The next moves required decisions on mission
profiles and production facilities.</font></p>
