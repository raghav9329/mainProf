So after admin rights I installed Java, Eclipse, VBox
Now this morning I downloaded the MS IE [9,10,10] Win7 VMs
so that I can run IE for testing.

Eric sent me in SLACK  on 1/6/16 a link to 
http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/

giving me complete access to lotsÉ.

Back to use of the VMs
Notes: the admin password for all of the IE VMs is ÒPassword1Ó
