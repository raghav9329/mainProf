Dr. Cominsky
You and I have a common friend and past, and I would like to get your opinion and possible suggestions on direction or approach.

I was sitting in Tony Trono’s chair last week and was talking to him about Ideas. We’ve know each other for a few years, but he’s known my wife for 20 more than me.

Your name came up wen he described to me how one of his clients was reviewing massive amounts of technical data on a hand held device during one of their visits, and that is was somewhat similar to what I was briefly discussing with him.

Our past:  SSU, Physics Minor, Math Minor, CS Major 1993, specifically your two courses on Digital Electronics, and the Senior Digital Electronics with Applications course.
