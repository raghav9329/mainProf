# dd-cx-test    
##  All previous work in the DD-CX-TEST repository moved into /previousWork.
##  1/30/27 this is a new start on the Customer Experience Test Repository.
##  This work is developed around Node.js, Protractor, Jasmine, gulp etc. ( more to come on that list later )
##  Installation of this work is not currently defined.
##  	Choices are being discussed. Mark Atkinson currently leans toward Confluence but some notes could be put here.
